    "In this tutorial competition, we dig a little \"deeper\" into sentiment analysis. Google's Word2Vec is a deep-learning inspired method that focuses on the meaning of words. Word2Vec attempts to understand meaning and semantic relationships among words. It works in a way that is similar to deep approaches, such as recurrent neural nets or deep neural nets, but is computationally more efficient. This tutorial focuses on Word2Vec for sentiment analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sentiment analysis is a challenging subject in machine learning. People express their emotions in language that is often obscured by sarcasm, ambiguity, and plays on words, all of which could be very misleading for both humans and computers. There's another Kaggle competition for movie review sentiment analysis. In this tutorial we explore how Word2Vec can be applied to a similar problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Deep learning has been in the news a lot over the past few years, even making it to the front page of the New York Times. These machine learning techniques, inspired by the architecture of the human brain and made possible by recent advances in computing power, have been making waves via breakthrough results in image recognition, speech processing, and natural language tasks. Recently, deep learning approaches won several Kaggle competitions, including a drug discovery task, and cat and dog image recognition."

    "Now that we have our training reviews tidied up, how do we convert them to some kind of numeric representation for machine learning? One common approach is called a Bag of Words. The Bag of Words model learns a vocabulary from all of the documents, then models each document by counting the number of times each word appears. For example, consider the following two sentences:\n",
    "\n",
    "Sentence 1: \"The cat sat on the hat\"  \n",
    "Sentence 2: \"The dog ate the cat and the hat\"  \n",
    "\n",
    "From these two sentences, our vocabulary is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "{ the, cat, sat, on, hat, dog, ate, and }\n",
    "\n",
    "To get our bags of words, we count the number of times each word occurs in each sentence. In Sentence 1, \"the\" appears twice, and \"cat\", \"sat\", \"on\", and \"hat\" each appear once, so the feature vector for Sentence 1 is:\n",
    "\n",
    "{ the, cat, sat, on, hat, dog, ate, and }\n",
    "\n",
    "Sentence 1: { 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0 }\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, the features for Sentence 2 are: { 3, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1}\n",
    "\n",
    "In the IMDB data, we have a very large number of reviews, which will give us a large vocabulary. To limit the size of the feature vectors, we should choose some maximum vocabulary size. Below, we use the 5000 most frequent words (remembering that stop words have already been removed).\n",

    "--\n",
    "\n",
    "https://www.kaggle.com/c/word2vec-nlp-tutorial/details/part-2-word-vectors  \n",
    "\n",
    "Introducing Distributed Word Vectors: This part of the tutorial will focus on using distributed word vectors created by the Word2Vec algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "Word2vec, published by Google in 2013, is a neural network implementation that learns distributed representations for words. Other deep or recurrent neural network architectures had been proposed for learning word representations prior to this, but the major problem with these was the long time required to train the models. Word2vec learns quickly relative to other models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Word2Vec does not need labels in order to create meaningful representations. This is useful, since most data in the real world is unlabeled. If the network is given enough training data (tens of billions of words), it produces word vectors with intriguing characteristics. Words with similar meanings appear in clusters, and clusters are spaced such that some word relationships, such as analogies, can be reproduced using vector math. The famous example is that, with highly trained word vectors, \"king - man + woman = queen.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Distributed word vectors are powerful and can be used for many applications, particularly word prediction and translation. Here, we will try to apply them to sentiment analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using word2vec in Python: In Python, we will use the excellent implementation of word2vec from the gensim package. If you don't already have gensim installed, you'll need to install it. There is an excellent tutorial that accompanies the Python Word2Vec implementation, here.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although Word2Vec does not require graphics processing units (GPUs) like many deep learning algorithms, it is compute intensive. Both Google's version and the Python version rely on multi-threading (running multiple processes in parallel on your computer to save time). ln order to train your model in a reasonable amount of time, you will need to install cython (instructions here). Word2Vec will run without cython installed, but it will take days to run instead of minutes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Preparing to Train a Model\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we read in the data with pandas, as we did in Part 1. Unlike Part 1, we now use unlabeledTrain.tsv, which contains 50,000 additional reviews with no labels. When we built the Bag of Words model in Part 1, extra unlabeled training reviews were not useful. However, since Word2Vec can learn from unlabeled data, these extra 50,000 reviews can now be used.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The functions we write to clean the data are also similar to Part 1, although now there are a couple of differences. First, to train Word2Vec it is better not to remove stop words because the algorithm relies on the broader context of the sentence in order to produce high-quality word vectors. For this reason, we will make stop word removal optional in the functions below. It also might be better not to remove numbers, but we leave that as an exercise for the reader.  "

    "\n",
    "A few things to try:\n",
    "\n",
    "First, training Word2Vec on a lot more text should greatly improve performance. Google's results are based on word vectors that were learned out of more than a billion-word corpus; our labeled and unlabeled training sets together are only a measly 18 million words or so. Conveniently, Word2Vec provides functions to load any pre-trained model that is output by Google's original C tool, so it's also possible to train a model in C and then import it into Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, in published literature, distributed word vector techniques have been shown to outperform Bag of Words models. In this paper, an algorithm called Paragraph Vector is used on the IMDB dataset to produce some of the most state-of-the-art results to date. In part, it does better than the approaches we try here because vector averaging and clustering lose the word order, whereas Paragraph Vectors preserves word order information."

In deep learning systems, this is not the case -- instead, algorithms can automatically learn feature hierarchies, which represent objects in increasing levels of abstraction.
