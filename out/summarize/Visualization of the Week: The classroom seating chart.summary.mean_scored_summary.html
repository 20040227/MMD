    <body><p><strong>School is back in session for most college students, and by now many have chosen the seats they plan to occupy for the rest of the semester.</strong> Of course, where you choose to sit depends on a number of factors: the size of the class, the layout of the seats, the friends you have or make there, and your preference for the front or the back of the room. 

 <strong>Software development and design company Skyrill has created a visualization of the seating habits of a graduate-level class at MIT.</strong> It shows that these particular students tend to move around quite a bit. 

  <strong>Screenshot of Skyrill's "Classroom seating habits" visualization.</strong> The top of the visualization shows the front of the classroom. Circle sizes represent how often a student sat in a particular seat. Click to see the full interactive version . 

 The top of the visualization shows the front of the classroom, and it moves back from there. The larger the circle, the more often a student has sat in that seat. 

 <strong>The interactive visualization lets you select different numbers of students, and you can animate it to see where they sat throughout the semester.</strong> You can also choose to focus on those students who chose to sit in the same "zone" or those who moved around a lot. 

 The visualization was created using d3 and jQuery.
