    <body>Here are a few of the <strong>data stories</strong> that caught my <strong>attention</strong> this week. Crowdsourcing and gaming <strong>helps</strong> in the <strong>fight</strong> against HIV 

 Players of the <strong>online protein-folding game Fold.it</strong> have solved a scientific <strong>problem</strong> in three <strong>weeks</strong>' <strong>time</strong> that has stumped <strong>researchers</strong> for more than a decade. <strong>Scientists</strong> have been trying to figure out the <strong>structure</strong> of a protein-cutting <strong>enzyme</strong> from an AIDS-like <strong>virus</strong>, but failing to do so, turned the <strong>information</strong> over to Fold.it <strong>players</strong>, challenging them to see if they could produce an accurate model. <strong>"</strong>We wanted to see if human <strong>intuition</strong> could succeed where automated <strong>methods</strong> had failed,<strong>"</strong> Dr. Firas Khatib of the <strong>University</strong> of <strong>Washington Department</strong> of <strong>Biochemistry</strong> told Science Daily . And indeed, it did. The <strong>goal</strong> was to work out the three-dimensional <strong>structure</strong> of different proteins. <strong>Players</strong>, most of whom were not trained <strong>scientists</strong>, competed with one another and were scored based on the stability of what they built. But they could also work together on solving the various puzzles. And, in this <strong>case</strong>, by <strong>playing Fold.it</strong>, the <strong>gamers</strong> generated <strong>models</strong> that were good enough for the <strong>researchers</strong> to determine the <strong>enzyme</strong>'s actual structure. This included <strong>elements</strong> that could be targeted by <strong>drugs</strong> that could take on the enzyme. <strong>Twitter</strong> open <strong>sources</strong> <strong><strong>Storm</strong></strong> and acquires Julpan 

 As <strong>Twitter</strong> indicated it would do last <strong>month</strong> , the <strong>company</strong> has open sourced <strong><strong>Storm</strong></strong>, its Hadoop-like, real-time <strong>data</strong> processing tool. <strong>Storm</strong> was developed by <strong><strong>Backtype</strong></strong> , which <strong><strong>Twitter</strong></strong> acquired earlier this <strong>year</strong>, and <strong><strong>Twitter</strong></strong> <strong>engineer</strong> <strong>Nathan Marz</strong>, formerly the lead <strong>engineer</strong> at <strong><strong>Backtype</strong></strong>, made the open <strong>source release official</strong> at the <strong>Strange Loop</strong> developer conference. Along with the <strong>code</strong> , there's extensive <strong>documentation</strong> of the <strong>project</strong>, as well as other <strong>resources</strong> <strong>Marz</strong> <strong>lists</strong> on a <strong>Hacker News</strong> <strong>thread</strong> about the <strong>project</strong>. The open <strong>sourcing</strong> of <strong>Storm</strong> wasn't the only <strong>data</strong> <strong>news</strong> from <strong>Twitter</strong> this week. The <strong>company</strong> has also acquired <strong>Julpan</strong> , a <strong>New York</strong> City-based <strong>startup</strong> that analyzes real-time <strong>data</strong> collected from the social web. The <strong><strong>acquisition</strong></strong> is the latest in a <strong>series</strong> of <strong><strong>moves</strong></strong> by <strong>Twitter</strong> to build out its own <strong>analytics capabilities</strong> — <strong><strong>moves</strong></strong> that <strong>include</strong> the <strong><strong>acquisition</strong></strong> of <strong>BackType —</strong> to analyze the more than 200 million <strong>Tweets</strong> that are now posted per day. <strong>Julpan</strong> is headed by former <strong>Google</strong> <strong>data</strong> scientist Ori Allon. <strong>Allon</strong> built <strong>"</strong>Orion,<strong>"</strong> a <strong>search algorithm</strong> that became a key <strong>part</strong> of <strong>Google</strong>'s <strong>search relevancy</strong> <strong>efforts</strong> when the <strong>company</strong> acquired the rights to it in 2006. <strong>Allon</strong> left <strong>Google</strong> in 2010 to found Julpan. The <strong>politics</strong> of <strong>search</strong> 

 <strong>Google Chairman Eric Schmidt</strong> testified before the <strong>Senate Judiciary Subcommittee</strong> on <strong>Antitrust</strong>, <strong>Competition Policy</strong> and <strong>Consumer Rights</strong> <strong>yesterday</strong> — a <strong>hearing</strong> that <strong>GigaOm</strong>'s <strong>Stacey Higginbotham</strong> said demonstrated a "fundamental conflict of <strong>cultures</strong>" between <strong>Silicon Valley</strong> and Washington DC. The <strong>purpose</strong> of the <strong>Senate</strong> <strong>hearing</strong> is to investigate <strong><strong>Google</strong></strong>'s <strong><strong>search</strong></strong> <strong>practices</strong> and to ascertain whether or not <strong><strong>Google</strong></strong>'s <strong>dominance</strong> over <strong><strong>search</strong></strong> and <strong><strong>search</strong></strong> advertising <strong>warrants</strong> an anti-trust <strong>response</strong> from the government. As <strong>Senator Patrick Leahy</strong> put it, the <strong>hearings</strong> are meant to see whether "<strong>Google</strong> is in a <strong>position</strong> to determine who will succeed and fail on the Internet. <strong>"</strong> Many of the <strong>questions</strong> from the <strong>senators</strong> involved how <strong>Google</strong> handles search ranking. <strong>Senator Mike Lee</strong> accused the <strong>company</strong> of cooking <strong>search</strong> <strong>results</strong>, an <strong>accusation</strong> that Schmidt denied. <strong>"</strong><strong>First</strong>, we built <strong>search</strong> for <strong>users</strong>, not websites,<strong>"</strong> Schmidt testified. <strong>"</strong>And no <strong>matter</strong> what we do, there will always be some websites unhappy with where they rank. <strong>Search</strong> is subjective, and there's no 'correct' <strong>set</strong> of <strong>search</strong> results. Our scientific <strong>process</strong> is designed to provide the <strong>answers</strong> that consumers will find most useful. <strong>"</strong> 

 <strong>GigaOm</strong>'s <strong>Higginbotham</strong> describes what she sees as a <strong>clash</strong> of <strong>cultures</strong> between the <strong>Senators</strong> and <strong>Google —</strong> and between <strong>politics</strong> and <strong>algorithms</strong> — thusly: 

 <strong>Schmidt</strong>, like any <strong>computer scientist</strong>, tried to argue that the <strong>algorithms</strong> do what they are supposed to do. From a <strong>computer science view</strong>, if an <strong>algorithm</strong> is fair, then changing to protect a certain <strong>class</strong> of those affected by it makes it fundamentally unfair to <strong>others</strong> (<strong>something</strong> <strong>Congress</strong> routinely does with <strong>exceptions</strong> and carve <strong>outs</strong> when it's making legislation). In <strong>fact</strong>, the biggest <strong>elephant</strong> in the <strong>room</strong> was a <strong>clash</strong> of <strong><strong>culture</strong>s</strong> between the <strong>Silicon Valley</strong> <strong>culture</strong> of the free <strong>market</strong> — and using <strong>technology</strong> to create a better <strong>consumer experience</strong> — and <strong>Washington D.C.</strong>'s <strong>inherent cynicism</strong> and pandering to constituents. <strong><strong>Strata Conference</strong></strong> in New York 

 O'Reilly's <strong><strong>Strata Conference</strong></strong> has been going on this <strong>week</strong> in <strong>New York City</strong>, with <strong>Strata Jumpstart</strong> and <strong>Strata Summit</strong> <strong>kicking</strong> off the <strong>week</strong>. <strong>Video</strong> and <strong>speaker</strong> <strong>slides</strong> from earlier in the <strong><strong>week</strong></strong> are available <strong>online</strong>, and you can watch streaming <strong>video</strong> from the <strong>rest</strong> of the <strong><strong>week</strong></strong>'s events. <strong>Got</strong> <strong>data</strong> news?
