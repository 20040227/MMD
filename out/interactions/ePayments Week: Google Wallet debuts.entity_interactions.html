    <body>Here's what caught my <strong>attention</strong> in the <strong>payments</strong> <strong>space</strong> this week. The mobile <strong>wallet</strong> is here 

 
 <strong>Google Wallet</strong> officially launched this <strong>week</strong> with <strong>payment</strong> <strong>partners</strong> <strong>Citi</strong> and <strong>MasterCard</strong> on <strong>board</strong> and three other <strong>credit card</strong> <strong>networks</strong> (<strong>Visa</strong>, <strong>Discover</strong> and American Express) waiting in the wings. <strong>Version</strong> 1.0 is pretty much what <strong>Google</strong> said it would be when it announced the <strong>service</strong> last May . <strong>Google</strong> is launching it first on <strong>Sprint</strong>'s <strong>network</strong>, and for now you need to have <strong>Samsung</strong>'s <strong>Nexus</strong> 4G — though there are several other NFC-compatible <strong>devices</strong> in use today and more coming soon . You also have to find a <strong>MasterCard PayPass</strong> terminal <strong>—</strong> typically found in <strong>taxis</strong>, <strong>fast-food</strong> <strong>restaurants</strong> and <strong>convenience</strong> stores <strong>—</strong> to tap and pay. <strong>(</strong>If you're looking for the technical <strong>specs</strong> on how that <strong>works</strong>, <strong>MasterCard</strong>'s site has a <strong>handy interactive</strong> that shows how tapping the <strong>phone</strong> emits a beep from the terminal. <strong>)</strong> 

 <strong>Payment</strong> with the <strong>phone</strong> is only <strong>part</strong> of the <strong>value proposition</strong>; <strong>Google</strong> knows that won't be enough to convince consumers to use it. The <strong>integration</strong> of <strong>payment</strong> with <strong>rewards</strong>, <strong>loyalty</strong> <strong>programs</strong>, and <strong>coupons</strong> is just as important <strong>—</strong> as this <strong>spoof video</strong> of the <strong><strong>"</strong></strong>first <strong>Google Wallet</strong> <strong>customer</strong>,<strong><strong>"</strong></strong> lifted from the <strong><strong>"</strong></strong>Seinfeld<strong><strong>"</strong></strong> archives, makes clear. It's a small <strong>start</strong>, with only a <strong>narrow slice</strong> of the smartphone user base able to tap into it. But who can doubt the <strong>promise</strong> of one of the <strong>Google</strong> <strong>engineers</strong> starring in the <strong>intro video</strong> when he says, "We're constantly working to improve the wallet. <strong>"</strong> 

 

 
It's worth <strong>noting</strong> that <strong><strong>PayPal</strong></strong> <strong>president</strong> <strong>Scott Thompson</strong> demoed their point-of-sale <strong>solution</strong> last <strong>week</strong>, emphasizing that <strong><strong>PayPal</strong></strong> isn't waiting for <strong>NFC</strong> and is instead considering <strong>multiple payment</strong> <strong>options</strong>, including <strong>bar</strong> <strong>codes</strong> (like <strong>Starbucks )</strong> and <strong>PIN</strong> <strong>confirmations</strong> (as with direct billing). Earlier this <strong>summer</strong>, <strong>Ogilvy</strong> & <strong>Mather</strong>'s <strong>Mobile Shopper</strong> <strong>survey</strong> found that far more <strong>consumers</strong> trusted <strong>PayPal</strong> to handle their mobile <strong>payments</strong> than <strong>Google (</strong>34.3<strong>% versus</strong> 19.5%). If <strong><strong>Google</strong></strong>'s <strong>challenge</strong> will be to earn <strong>consumer trust</strong>, <strong>PayPal</strong>'s will be to remain visible as <strong><strong>Google</strong></strong> and its high-profile <strong>partners</strong> push their solution. <strong>Mobile</strong> <strong><strong>payments</strong></strong> deemed <strong><strong>"</strong></strong>very unimportant<strong><strong>"</strong></strong> by some <strong>consumers</strong> 

 
If <strong>Sprint</strong> fails to report a <strong>wave</strong> of new <strong>customers</strong> who suddenly must have the <strong>Nexus</strong> 4G, it will come as no <strong>surprise</strong> to the <strong>folks</strong> at <strong>Lightspeed Research</strong> who reported this <strong>week</strong> that mobile <strong><strong>payments</strong></strong> are <strong><strong>"</strong></strong>very unimportant<strong><strong>"</strong></strong> to more than half of all <strong>smartphone</strong> users. Only 15% said that mobile payments were somewhat or very important. An <strong>article</strong> in American <strong>Banker</strong> quotes <strong>Jim Smith</strong>, <strong>president</strong> of <strong>Blue Dun</strong> <strong>consultancy</strong>, saying that <strong>consumers</strong> are basically satisfied with their current <strong>mobile payment solution</strong>, the <strong>credit card</strong>: "The <strong>killer application</strong> in mobile <strong>payments</strong> hasn't happened yet," Smith said. <strong>(</strong>Presumably, he hasn't seen <strong>Google</strong>'s "Seinfeld" parody. <strong>)</strong> 
 
 
Lightspeed also reported that mobile <strong>app usage</strong> <strong>differs</strong> widely among <strong>customers</strong> of different <strong>credit</strong> <strong>cards</strong> and banks. Among the interesting <strong>differences</strong>: 

 
 <strong>Smartphone</strong> <strong>penetration</strong> is highest among <strong>American Express</strong> and <strong>HSBC</strong> <strong>customers</strong> — both at 37%. Discover is the only <strong>issuer</strong> with more than 50<strong>%</strong> of its <strong>customers</strong> still using "basic <strong>mobile</strong> phones. <strong>"</strong> In <strong>line</strong> with this, they have the lowest <strong>penetration</strong> of <strong>smartphone</strong> <strong>users</strong> at 28%. 37<strong>%</strong> of <strong><strong>Wells Fargo</strong></strong> <strong>credit <strong>card</strong></strong> <strong>customers</strong> said they have downloaded the <strong><strong>Wells Fargo</strong></strong> <strong>mobile app</strong> — the highest <strong>penetration</strong> among the <strong>card</strong> issuers analyzed. <strong>Android Open</strong> , being held <strong>October</strong> 9-11 in <strong>San Francisco</strong>, is a big-tent <strong>meeting ground</strong> for <strong>app</strong> and <strong>game</strong> <strong>developers</strong>, <strong>carriers</strong>, <strong>chip</strong> <strong>manufacturers</strong>, <strong>content</strong> <strong>creators</strong>, <strong>OEMs</strong>, <strong>researchers</strong>, <strong>entrepreneurs</strong>, <strong>VCs</strong>, and <strong>business</strong> leaders. <strong>Save</strong> 20<strong>%</strong> on <strong>registration</strong> with the <strong>code</strong> AN11RAD 

 Who's that <strong>Android</strong> user? <strong>Tech</strong> <strong>blog</strong> <strong>Mobile17</strong> published a nice infographic on <strong>Android</strong> <strong>users</strong> , drawing on <strong>data</strong> from <strong>Nielsen</strong>, <strong>AdMob</strong>, <strong>Hunch.com</strong>, and others. One of their <strong>sources</strong> was a similar graphic from <strong>Mostly Blog</strong> published back in <strong>August</strong>, contrasting <strong>Android</strong> and <strong>iOS</strong> users. Among the more interesting <strong>findings</strong> in <strong>Mobile17</strong>'s graphic: 

 
 <strong>Android</strong> <strong>owners</strong> talk on their <strong>phones</strong> about 15<strong>%</strong> of the time. They're on <strong>apps</strong> more than 56<strong><strong>%</strong></strong> of the <strong>time</strong>, not including <strong>email</strong> and messaging <strong>(</strong>19<strong><strong>%</strong></strong>) and <strong>web</strong> browsing <strong>(</strong>9<strong><strong>%</strong></strong>). <strong>Android</strong> <strong><strong>users</strong></strong> are more likely than <strong>iOS</strong> <strong><strong>users</strong></strong> to be <strong>guys</strong>, more likely to be conservative, and more likely to be pessimists. They also are 80<strong>%</strong> more likely to have only a high <strong>school diploma</strong> (that is, no <strong>college degree</strong>) than <strong>iOS</strong> users. That <strong>Samsung Nexus</strong> 4G you need to use <strong>Google</strong>'s Wallet? It's not in the top <strong>ten</strong> most popular <strong>Android</strong> phones. Of <strong>course</strong>, we can't infer simple <strong>conclusions</strong> about <strong>demographics</strong> and <strong><strong>preference</strong>s</strong> for <strong>Google</strong>'s <strong>operating system versus</strong> <strong>Apple</strong>'s without also taking into <strong>consideration</strong> that <strong>Android</strong> <strong>mobiles</strong> are offered (by <strong>multiple handset</strong> <strong>vendors</strong>) at lower <strong>price</strong> <strong>points</strong> than the <strong>iPhone —</strong> so, <strong>income</strong> may be driving that <strong>preference</strong> more than other factors.
