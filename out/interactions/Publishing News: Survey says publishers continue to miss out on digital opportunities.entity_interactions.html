    <body>Here's what caught my <strong>attention</strong> this <strong>week</strong> in publishing news. <strong>Digital</strong> <strong>publishing</strong> <strong>opportunities</strong> continue to elude <strong>publishers</strong> 

 <strong>Aptara</strong>'s <strong>Third Annual eBook Survey</strong> of <strong>Publishers</strong> was released this week. Overall, the <strong>study</strong> showed that <strong>publishers</strong> aren't yet making the most of digital opportunities. The <strong>survey</strong> revealed that <strong>"</strong>one out of five <strong>ebook</strong> <strong><strong>publishers</strong></strong> generates more than 10<strong>%</strong> of their <strong>sales</strong> from <strong>ebook</strong>s<strong>"</strong> — a pretty good <strong>number</strong> for this <strong>stage</strong> of the <strong>game</strong> — but that there are far more <strong>market</strong> <strong>opportunities</strong> yet untapped, <strong>"</strong>particularly for the <strong>majority</strong> of <strong><strong>publishers</strong></strong> that are still eluded by <strong>production</strong> <strong>efficiencies</strong> and meaningful revenues. <strong>"</strong> 

 Some interesting <strong>highlights</strong> from the <strong>report include</strong>: 

 
 <strong>Publishers</strong>' <strong>awareness</strong> of <strong>EPUB</strong> 3 and <strong>pursuit</strong> of enhanced ebooks is limited. <strong><strong>EPUB</strong></strong> 3 is the next <strong>edition</strong> of the <strong><strong>EPUB</strong></strong> <strong>ebook format standard</strong> and includes significant <strong>support</strong> for enhancements. There is a general <strong>lack</strong> of <strong>awareness</strong> of it and its <strong>benefits</strong> across all <strong>publisher</strong> types. While there has been a sizeable <strong>increase</strong> in enhanced <strong>ebook production</strong> in the past <strong>year</strong>, 60<strong>%</strong> of <strong>publishers</strong> are either still investigating or have no <strong>plans</strong> to produce enhanced ebooks. <strong>Results</strong> for <strong>survey question</strong> 16: <strong>Do</strong> you have a <strong>strategy</strong> for <strong>moving</strong> to the <strong>EPUB3</strong> standard once it is finalized? Two out of three <strong>ebook</strong> <strong>publishers</strong> have not converted the <strong>majority</strong> of their <strong>backlist</strong> (<strong>legacy</strong>) <strong>titles</strong> to <strong>ebook</strong>s. With higher <strong>profit</strong> <strong>margins</strong> than <strong>frontlist</strong> <strong>titles</strong>, these digital <strong>assets</strong> hold significant untapped revenue potential. The question of "digital or print? " has been answered. The answer is both: "digital and print. <strong>"</strong> The vast <strong>majority</strong> of <strong>book</strong> <strong>publishers</strong> (85<strong>%</strong>), across all <strong>market</strong> <strong>segments</strong>, are producing <strong>print</strong> and e<strong>book</strong> <strong>versions</strong> of their titles. For the <strong>time</strong> being, <strong>print publishing</strong>'s <strong>legacy cost structure</strong> and <strong>business</strong> and <strong>production</strong> <strong>models</strong> are living <strong>alongside newer</strong> ebook-inspired practices. Most <strong>ebook production</strong> still follows outdated <strong>print production</strong> <strong>models</strong> at the <strong>expense</strong> of significant operational efficiencies. Though <strong>publishers</strong> are pursuing multiple-output <strong><strong>production</strong></strong> (<strong>print</strong> and <strong>ebooks</strong>), they are slow to <strong>transition</strong> from a traditional <strong>print</strong>-based <strong><strong>production</strong></strong> to more flexible and scalable <strong>digital</strong> workflows that <strong>produce output</strong> for mobile <strong>devices</strong>, <strong>PCs</strong>, and <strong>print</strong>-all from a single content source. The full report can be downloaded here . <strong>News <strong>organizations</strong></strong> continue to venture into <strong>ebook publishing</strong> 

 The <strong>idea</strong> of <strong><strong>news</strong>papers</strong>, <strong><strong>magazines</strong></strong> and other <strong>news</strong> <strong>organizations</strong> publishing <strong>ebooks</strong> isn't new, but as <strong><strong>news</strong>papers</strong> and <strong><strong>magazines</strong></strong> continue to struggle to find their <strong>way</strong> (and their <strong>revenue</strong>) in the new <strong>digital landscape</strong>, the <strong>practice</strong> is becoming a lot more common. A <strong>post</strong> this <strong>week</strong> in the <strong>New York Times</strong> took a <strong>look</strong> at this <strong>burgeoning market</strong> and how it's affecting <strong>ebook</strong> <strong>publishing</strong>: 
 
 Swiftly and at little <strong>cost</strong>, <strong>newspapers</strong>, <strong>magazines</strong> and <strong>sites</strong> like The <strong>Huffington Post</strong> are hunting for <strong>revenue</strong> by <strong>publishing</strong> their own <strong>version</strong> of <strong>ebook</strong>s, either using brand-new <strong>content</strong> or repurposing material that they may have given away free in the past. And by making <strong>e-<strong>book</strong>s</strong> that are usually shorter, cheaper to buy and more quickly produced than the typical <strong>book</strong>, they are redefining what an e<strong>book</strong> is — and who gets to publish it. The <strong>practice</strong> <strong>extends</strong> to <strong>technology</strong> <strong>manuals</strong> as well — take a <strong>look</strong> at the <strong>Ars</strong> <strong>Technica Mac OS X Lion</strong> <strong>review</strong> that the <strong>company</strong> turned into an <strong>ebook</strong> ( here's its <strong>page</strong> on Goodreads ). Taking into <strong>consideration</strong> the nimble <strong>nature</strong> of <strong>ebook publishing</strong> and the high <strong>ROI</strong> for <strong>news</strong> <strong>organizations</strong>, this <strong>blossoming</strong> new <strong>rivalry</strong> for traditional publishers is likely to continue. Finally, a <strong><strong><strong>recipe</strong></strong> organization site</strong> that really gets it 

 <strong>Recipe</strong> sites and <strong>apps</strong> are popping up all over the <strong>place</strong> , but for <strong><strong>recipe</strong></strong> <strong>hunter/gatherers</strong> like myself, the <strong>modus operandi</strong> of emailing <strong><strong>recipe</strong></strong> <strong>links</strong> and storing them in <strong>inbox</strong> <strong>folders</strong> continued to be a better <strong>(</strong>though <strong>messy</strong>) solution. Until now. <strong>KeepRecipes</strong> — reviewed this <strong>week</strong> in <strong>Mashable —</strong> provides a solution that really works. As <strong>Sarah Kessler</strong> explains in the <strong>Mashable</strong> <strong>post</strong>, the <strong>site</strong> works like <strong>Instapaper —</strong> <strong>users</strong> install a <strong>bookmarklet</strong> they can click while on a recipe page they want to save. <strong>Kessler</strong>'s <strong>rundown</strong> of how it works is great, but she gives one important <strong>tip</strong> that ultimately makes a big <strong>difference</strong>: 

 Due to <strong>copyright</strong> <strong>issues</strong>, the <strong>bookmarklet</strong> can only auto-populate the <strong>ingredient list</strong> of the recipe. But if the <strong>user</strong> <strong>highlights instructions</strong> before clicking the <strong>bookmarklet</strong>, those are also saved with the ingredient list. While <strong>playing</strong> with the <strong>app</strong>, I found a <strong>couple</strong> <strong>instances</strong> where the <strong>ingredient list</strong> didn't auto-populate as well, but the highlighting trick worked for that, too. Other useful <strong>features</strong> include an <strong>auto-population</strong> of the <strong>recipe source link</strong>, and the <strong>site</strong> coordinates with an <strong>iPhone</strong> <strong>app</strong>, so you can easily <strong>access ingredient</strong> <strong>lists</strong> while at the grocery store. One of the more exciting <strong>aspects</strong> of this <strong>site</strong> is that it's looking to <strong>partner</strong> with <strong>publishers</strong> to sell digital <strong>editions</strong> of <strong>cookbooks</strong> that <strong>users</strong> can buy and download directly into their KeepRecipes folders. <strong>Kessler</strong> noted that the <strong><strong><strong>"</strong></strong></strong>Not Your Mother's<strong><strong><strong>"</strong></strong></strong> <strong><strong>series</strong></strong>, <strong>A. J. Rathbun</strong>'s <strong>cocktail book</strong> <strong><strong><strong>"</strong></strong></strong><strong>Dark</strong> <strong>Sprits</strong><strong><strong><strong>"</strong></strong></strong> and cookbooks from the <strong><strong><strong>"</strong></strong></strong>A <strong>Baker</strong>'s Field Guide<strong><strong><strong>"</strong></strong></strong> <strong><strong>series</strong></strong> are on <strong>deck</strong> for a <strong>Thanksgiving</strong> release. This not only offers potential <strong>revenue</strong> for <strong>publishers</strong>, it's very useful for consumers. It also could set the <strong>stage</strong> for <strong>selling</strong> individual <strong>recipes</strong> from <strong>cookbooks</strong> as one-offs. <strong><strong>TOC Frankfurt</strong></strong> 2011 — <strong>Being</strong> held on <strong>Tues<strong>day</strong></strong>, <strong>Oct.</strong> 11, 2011, <strong><strong>TOC Frankfurt</strong></strong> will feature a full <strong>day</strong> of cutting-edge <strong>keynotes</strong> and <strong>panel</strong> <strong>discussions</strong> by key <strong>figures</strong> in the <strong>worlds</strong> of publishing and technology. <strong>Save</strong> 100€ off the regular <strong>admission price</strong> with <strong>code</strong> TOC2011OR
