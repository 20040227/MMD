    <body>This <strong>post</strong> originally appeared on <strong>Joe Wikert</strong>'s <strong>Publishing</strong> 2020 Blog (" What Good Are Ebook "Daily Deals" & Other Deep Discounts? "). It's republished with permission. I admit it. I check <strong>Amazon</strong>'s <strong>Kindle Daily Deal</strong> every day. Every single day. Why? As a <strong>publisher</strong> I'm curious to see what they're offering and as a <strong>consumer</strong> I don't want to miss out on a great deal. <strong>(</strong>In the <strong>spirit</strong> of full <strong>disclosure</strong>, at O'Reilly <strong>Media</strong> we offer an <strong>ebook</strong> or <strong>video deal</strong> of the day too. In <strong>fact</strong>, our <strong>program</strong> was in <strong>place</strong> long before <strong>Amazon</strong> started theirs. <strong>Everything</strong> I'm about to say below <strong>pertains</strong> not only to <strong>Amazon</strong>'s <strong>program</strong> but O'Reilly's and everyone else's as well. <strong>)</strong> 

 As a <strong>publisher</strong> I worry about the <strong>mindset</strong> we're reinforcing that <strong>content</strong> needs to be deeply discounted to garner customer attention. <strong>Amazon</strong> started this <strong>thinking</strong> by <strong>pricing</strong> so many <strong>Kindle</strong> <strong>editions</strong> at $9.99 even when they took a <strong>loss</strong> on each sale. And now the <strong>Kindle Daily Deals</strong> are often priced at $1.99-$2.99 or less, so the effective <strong>discounts</strong> off digital <strong>list price</strong> are 80-90% or higher. You might ask, "what's the harm"? After all, brick-and-mortar <strong>retailers</strong> of all <strong>shapes</strong> and <strong>sizes</strong> have offered <strong>deep</strong> <strong>discounts</strong> as a <strong>way</strong> of getting the <strong>customer</strong> into the store. That's why a <strong>grocery store</strong> <strong>sells</strong> a <strong>gallon</strong> of <strong>milk</strong> at a <strong>loss</strong> and hopes that you'll pick up several other profitable <strong>items</strong> between the <strong>dairy section</strong> and the checkout counter. And that's the problem. When I go to the grocery store I always wind up buying something more than what I went in for but that never happens when I buy online. I find I'm willing to let more <strong>items</strong> catch my <strong>eye</strong> in a physical <strong>store</strong> than an online <strong>store</strong>, so impulse buys are the <strong>norm</strong> for me in a physical <strong>store</strong>. When I'm online I'm much more of a destination shopper. I have something in mind. If I find it at the right price I buy it and nothing else. So I've now bought three or four of the <strong>Kindle Daily Deal</strong> titles but they were all bought <strong>alone</strong> as single-title transactions. Each <strong>day</strong> when I check the Daily Deal I'm greeted by <strong>plenty</strong> of other <strong>products</strong> and <strong>offers</strong> on Amazon but I don't bother with any of them. <strong><strong>TOC Frankfurt</strong></strong> 2011 — <strong>Being</strong> held on <strong>Tues<strong>day</strong></strong>, <strong>Oct.</strong> 11, 2011, <strong><strong>TOC Frankfurt</strong></strong> will feature a full <strong>day</strong> of cutting-edge <strong>keynotes</strong> and <strong>panel</strong> <strong>discussions</strong> by key <strong>figures</strong> in the <strong>worlds</strong> of publishing and technology. <strong>Save</strong> 100€ off the regular <strong>admission price</strong> with <strong>code</strong> TOC2011OR 

 You might still say the <strong>deal</strong> is good for both <strong>Amazon</strong> and that <strong>day</strong>'s publisher/author. I'm not so sure. One <strong>way</strong> of measuring that would be monitoring how long the discounted <strong>title</strong> continues to sell through at higher <strong>levels</strong> after the discount ends. I don't have any <strong>statistics</strong> to prove this <strong>(</strong>since <strong><strong>Amazon</strong></strong> doesn't share the <strong>data</strong>) but just watching <strong><strong>Amazon</strong></strong>'s <strong>Kindle</strong> <strong>bestseller list</strong> <strong>tells</strong> me the <strong>Daily Deal</strong> titles typically stick around the top 5 or so for another day or two and then pretty much disappear from the top 25-50. Maybe they're still selling at a higher <strong>rate</strong> than they did pre-promo but if that's the <strong>case</strong> you'd think <strong>Amazon</strong> would be playing that up with <strong>publishers</strong> and authors. I haven't heard a word from them about it. Meanwhile, the <strong>Amazon</strong> <strong>program</strong> is causing me to change my <strong>behavior</strong>, but not in a good way. I used to take a <strong>closer look</strong> at the <strong>Amazon</strong> <strong>home page</strong> for other <strong>campaigns</strong> but now I pretty much check the <strong>Daily Deal</strong> and head out. To make <strong>matters</strong> worse, one of the recent <strong>Daily Deal</strong> titles was one I paid full <strong>price</strong> for several months ago. That one <strong>left</strong> a bad <strong>taste</strong> in my <strong>mouth</strong> all day. I should point out that I'm a <strong>fan</strong> of <strong>discounts</strong> and promotional <strong>campaigns</strong> ... as long as they lead to <strong>something</strong> more meaningful than a one-and-done transaction. So why not make these <strong>deals</strong> <strong>part</strong> of some membership program? There are a lot of directions that could head in. For <strong>example</strong>, if I buy five <strong>books</strong> at regular <strong>price</strong> I get the sixth one of my choice for only $0.99. Or what if the <strong>Amazon Daily Deal</strong> was always priced at $2.99 to $4.99 but if I'm a <strong>Prime</strong> <strong>member</strong> I get it for $0.99 cents? In that <strong>model</strong> the general public still gets a <strong>deal</strong> (<strong>albeit</strong> not as deep a <strong>discount</strong> as <strong>today</strong>) but <strong>customers</strong> are encouraged to join a <strong>membership program</strong> that should lead to even more <strong>purchases</strong> down the road. That's all I'm asking for. <strong>Let</strong>'s <strong>get</strong> away from these one-product <strong>deep discount</strong> <strong>campaigns</strong> and start thinking about how to build a much more extensive <strong>relationship</strong> with our customers. P.S. Again, since O'Reilly offers an <strong>ebook deal-of-the-day program</strong> I'm going to see if I can grab our <strong>head</strong> of <strong>online</strong>, <strong>Allen Noren</strong> , to join me in a <strong>TOC</strong> <strong>podcast</strong> where we can talk further about our <strong>results</strong>, what <strong>works</strong>, what doesn't, and how we might want to think about tailoring it for the future. <strong>Stay</strong> tuned for more <strong>details</strong> on that podcast interview. <strong>Associated</strong> photo on <strong>home</strong> and <strong>category</strong> <strong>pages</strong>: Bullring - <strong>Selfridges</strong> lit up in the <strong>evening</strong> - <strong>Sale</strong> by <strong>ell</strong> brown, on Flickr</body>
