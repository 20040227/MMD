    <body>The <strong>days</strong> of relying on a <strong>print newspaper</strong> and a <strong>television anchor</strong> telling us "the way it is" are long gone. In 2011, <strong>Americans</strong> and <strong>citizens</strong> the <strong>world</strong> over <strong>consume news</strong> on <strong>multiple</strong> <strong>screens</strong> and platforms. Increasingly, we all <strong>contribute</strong> <strong>reports</strong> ourselves, using Internet-connected smartphones. A new <strong>report</strong> on local <strong>news</strong> by the <strong>Pew Research Center</strong>'s <strong>Project</strong> for <strong>Excellence</strong> in <strong>Journalism</strong> and the <strong>Pew Internet</strong> & American Life <strong>Project</strong> provides <strong>reason</strong> to be hopeful about new <strong>information</strong> platforms. But the <strong>report</strong> also reveals deep <strong>concern</strong> about the <strong>decay</strong> of local <strong>newspapers</strong>, and what that will mean for local government accountability. "Research in the past about how <strong>people</strong> get <strong>information</strong> about their <strong>communities</strong> tended to focus on a single <strong>question</strong>: 'Where do you go most often to get local news? ',<strong>"</strong> noted <strong>Tom Rosenstiel</strong>, <strong>Director</strong> of the <strong>Pew Excellence</strong> in <strong>Journalism</strong> <strong>project</strong> and <strong>co-author</strong> of the new <strong>report</strong>, in a prepared statement. <strong>"</strong>This <strong>research</strong> asked about 16 different local <strong>topics</strong> and found a much more complex <strong>ecosystem</strong> in which <strong>people</strong> rely on different <strong>platforms</strong> for different <strong>topics</strong>. It turns out that each <strong>piece</strong> of the local <strong>information system</strong> has special roles to play. Our <strong>research</strong> sorted that out and we found that for some <strong>things</strong> <strong>TV</strong> <strong>matters</strong> most, for <strong>others newspapers</strong> and their <strong>websites</strong> are primary <strong>sources</strong>, and the <strong>Internet</strong> is used for still other topics. <strong>"</strong> 

 Specifically, the <strong>report</strong> found that <strong>Americans</strong> rely on local <strong>TV</strong> for <strong><strong>information</strong></strong> about popular local <strong>topics</strong>, including <strong>weather</strong> (89<strong><strong>%</strong></strong> use <strong>TV</strong> for this <strong><strong>information</strong></strong>), breaking <strong>news</strong> (80<strong><strong>%</strong></strong>), local <strong>politics</strong> (67<strong><strong>%</strong></strong>) and <strong>crime</strong> (66<strong><strong>%</strong></strong>). <strong>Americans</strong> use <strong>newspapers</strong> for <strong>breadth</strong> and <strong>depth</strong> of many more <strong>topics</strong>, particularly with <strong>respect</strong> to local government information. <strong>Newspapers</strong> supply "<strong>broccoli journalism</strong>" about the least popular <strong>topics</strong>, including <strong>zoning</strong> and <strong>development information</strong> (30<strong><strong><strong>%</strong></strong></strong>), local social <strong>services</strong> (35<strong><strong><strong>%</strong></strong></strong>), <strong>job</strong> <strong>openings</strong> (39<strong><strong><strong>%</strong></strong></strong>) and local <strong>government</strong> <strong>activities</strong> (42<strong><strong><strong>%</strong></strong></strong>). These are <strong>topics</strong> that other local <strong>news</strong> institutions don't often deliver. The <strong>role</strong> of the <strong><strong>In</strong>ternet</strong> grows 

 <strong>In</strong> the latest <strong>confirmation</strong> of the <strong>growth</strong> of the <strong><strong>In</strong>ternet</strong> in modern <strong>life</strong>, we're increasingly going <strong>online</strong> when we're interested in <strong>gathering <strong>information</strong></strong> about specific local <strong>services</strong>, searching for <strong>information</strong> about <strong>education</strong>, <strong>restaurants</strong>, and <strong>business news</strong>, logging onto social <strong>media</strong> and accessing mobile <strong>devices</strong> to find and share what we learn ourselves. <strong>"</strong>The <strong>rise</strong> of <strong>search</strong> <strong>engines</strong> and <strong>specialty</strong> <strong>websites</strong> for different <strong>topics</strong> like <strong>weather</strong>, <strong>job</strong> <strong>postings</strong>, <strong>businesses</strong>, and even e-government have fractured and enriched the local <strong>news</strong> and <strong>information environment</strong>,<strong>"</strong> said <strong>Lee Rainie</strong>, <strong>director</strong> of the <strong>Pew Internet Project</strong> and another <strong>report co-author</strong>, in a prepared statement. Nearly <strong>half</strong> of <strong>adults</strong> (47<strong>%</strong>) now use mobile <strong>devices</strong> to get local <strong>news</strong> and information. The <strong>proliferation</strong> of <strong>smartphones</strong>, <strong>iPad</strong> <strong>apps</strong> and new platforms offers insight into a rapidly expanding mobile future. <strong>"</strong>We don't yet know exactly how important mobile <strong>apps</strong> will be, but it's pretty easy to sketch out a <strong>scenario</strong> where they rise in <strong>importance</strong>, especially when it comes to breaking <strong>news</strong>, <strong>weather</strong>, traffic, local <strong>politics</strong> and some of the more popular local <strong>topics</strong>,<strong>"</strong> said <strong>Rainie</strong> in an interview. The <strong>Internet</strong> has become a key <strong>source</strong> for peer-generated information. In <strong>fact</strong>, the <strong>survey</strong> showed that among <strong>adults</strong> under <strong>age</strong> 40, the <strong>Internet</strong> <strong>rivals</strong> or <strong>exceeds</strong> other <strong>platforms</strong> in every topic <strong>area save</strong> one: breaking local news. According to the <strong>study</strong>, the <strong>Internet</strong> has now become American <strong>adults</strong>' key <strong>source</strong> for five broad <strong>areas</strong> of <strong>information</strong>: 

 
 <strong>Restaurants</strong>, <strong>clubs</strong> and bars. Local businesses. Local schools. Local jobs. Local housing and real estate. The <strong>websites</strong> of local <strong>newspapers</strong> and <strong>TV</strong> <strong>stations</strong> aren't faring well, in <strong>terms</strong> of how the <strong>respondents</strong> rated their <strong>importance</strong> as a local news source. <strong><strong>"</strong></strong><strong>Local TV</strong> <strong>news</strong> websites barely registered,<strong><strong>"</strong></strong> <strong>reads</strong> the <strong>report</strong>, with less than 6<strong>%</strong> of those surveyed indicating that they depended on a <strong>legacy</strong> <strong>media</strong> <strong>organization</strong>'s website for local <strong>news</strong>. One clear <strong>finding</strong> from this <strong>report</strong> is that social <strong>media</strong> currently plays a small <strong>role</strong> in <strong>providing</strong> local <strong>information</strong> that citizens say they rely upon, with 18<strong><strong>%</strong></strong> using <strong>Facebook</strong> and 2<strong><strong>%</strong></strong> turning to Twitter. <strong><strong>"</strong></strong><strong>Social</strong> <strong>media</strong> look more like a supplemental <strong><strong>source</strong></strong> of <strong>information</strong> on these local <strong>topics</strong> than a primary, deeply-relied-upon <strong><strong>source</strong></strong>,<strong><strong>"</strong></strong> said <strong>Rainie</strong>, in an interview. "That's not too surprising to me. Local <strong>information</strong> is just one of the many <strong>things</strong> that <strong>people</strong> discuss and <strong>share</strong> on <strong>SMS</strong> and Twitter. <strong>"</strong> 

 While the <strong>report</strong> showed that <strong>citizens</strong> don't rely on social <strong>media</strong> for local news, they are definitely discussing it there. <strong>"</strong><strong>Participatory</strong> <strong>news</strong><strong>"</strong> is a full-blown <strong>phenomenon</strong>: 41<strong>%</strong> of <strong>respondents</strong> can be considered <strong>"</strong><strong>participators</strong><strong>"</strong> who publish information online. That said, such <strong>information</strong> is frequently about <strong>restaurants</strong> and <strong>community</strong> <strong>events</strong>, versus harder news. <strong><strong>Web</strong></strong> 2.0 <strong>Expo New York</strong> 2011 , being held <strong>Oct.</strong> 10-13, <strong>showcases</strong> the latest <strong><strong>Web</strong></strong> 2.0 <strong>business</strong> <strong>models</strong>, <strong>development</strong> <strong>tools</strong> and <strong>design</strong> <strong>strategies</strong> for the <strong>builders</strong> of the next-generation web. <strong>Save</strong> 20<strong>%</strong> on <strong>registration</strong> with <strong>code</strong> <strong>WEBNY11RAD</strong> 

 A digital <strong>generation gap</strong> 

 The <strong>question</strong> of what these <strong>trends</strong> mean for all <strong>levels</strong> of society is also critical to ask. <strong><strong>"</strong></strong><strong>People</strong> under <strong>age</strong> of 40 are a <strong>lot</strong> more likely than those over 40 to use the <strong>Internet</strong> on a <strong>host</strong> of the <strong>topics</strong> we probed,<strong><strong>"</strong></strong> said <strong>Rainie</strong> in our interview. <strong>"</strong>The <strong>gap</strong> is quite striking across a <strong>number</strong> of topics. As this <strong>younger cohort</strong> <strong>ages</strong>, it will probably expect <strong>legacy news</strong> <strong>organizations</strong> like <strong>newspapers</strong>, <strong>TV</strong>, and <strong>radio</strong>, to have an even more robust online presence. And they are likely to want to be able to contribute to <strong>news</strong> and easily share <strong>news</strong> with <strong>others</strong> via social media. <strong>"</strong> 

 A <strong>generation gap</strong> could have profound <strong>implications</strong> for how informed <strong>citizens</strong> can be about their <strong>communities</strong> in the <strong>future</strong>, based upon their <strong>consumption</strong> <strong>habits</strong> and the <strong>availability</strong> of information. <strong>"</strong>There is a <strong>disconnect</strong> in the <strong>public mind</strong> about <strong>newspapers</strong>, and that <strong>raises</strong> an important <strong>question</strong> about <strong>community information</strong> needs,<strong>"</strong> observed Rainie. <strong>"</strong>As we said in the <strong>report</strong>, 'If your local <strong><strong>news</strong>paper</strong> no <strong>longer</strong> existed, would that have a major <strong><strong>impact</strong></strong>, a minor <strong><strong>impact</strong></strong>, or no <strong><strong>impact</strong></strong> on your <strong>ability</strong> to keep up with <strong>information</strong> and <strong>news</strong> about your local community?'. A large <strong>majority</strong> of <strong>Americans</strong>, 69<strong><strong><strong>%</strong></strong></strong>, believe the <strong>death</strong> of their local <strong>newspaper</strong> would have no <strong>impact</strong> (39<strong><strong><strong>%</strong></strong></strong>) or only a minor <strong>impact</strong> (30<strong><strong><strong>%</strong></strong></strong>) on their <strong>ability</strong> to get local information. Yet, <strong>newspapers</strong> are the leading <strong>source</strong> that <strong>people</strong> rely on to get <strong>information</strong> about most of the civic <strong>topics</strong> on our list. So, if a local <strong>newspaper</strong> did vanish, it is not entirely clear which <strong>parts</strong> of the <strong>ecosystem</strong> would address those needs. <strong>Newspapers</strong> are deeply enmeshed in the local <strong>information system</strong> in <strong>ways</strong> that are pretty important to democracy. That's why the economic <strong>struggles</strong> of <strong>newspapers</strong> matter. <strong>"</strong> 

 <strong>Veterans</strong> of local <strong>news</strong> <strong>operations</strong> know that reality well. <strong><strong>"</strong></strong>This is <strong>something</strong> that I faced <strong>way</strong> back when I was at The <strong>Molokai Times</strong> in <strong>Hawaii</strong>,<strong><strong>"</strong></strong> commented <strong>Kate Gardiner</strong>, responding to a <strong>question</strong> on Facebook. <strong>Gardiner</strong> is a new <strong>media strategist</strong> that works with <strong>Al Jazeera</strong>, <strong>Lauch</strong> and the Poynter Institute. <strong>"</strong>We built a very robust <strong>online community</strong> to complement the hard <strong>copy</strong> and were experimenting with <strong>ways</strong> to make <strong>things</strong> even better for <strong>everyone</strong> — until the <strong>bottom</strong> dropped out and our major advertiser went bankrupt. The whole newspaper died. The <strong>community</strong> (about 5,000 <strong>people</strong>) was left with no <strong>alternative</strong> means of consuming news. Our competition sort of stepped up, but they weren't doing straight news. It's a <strong>problem</strong> on any <strong>number</strong> of <strong>levels</strong> — and there's no really obvious <strong>way</strong> to do a community-funded <strong>replacement</strong>, online or off. Given that context, do these <strong>findings</strong> add additional <strong>urgency</strong> to <strong>funding</strong> and creating new <strong>models</strong> for <strong>information aggregation</strong> and distribution online? <strong>"</strong>There aren't clear <strong>indications</strong> in our <strong>survey</strong> that <strong>speak</strong> to this <strong>question</strong>,<strong>"</strong> replied Rainie. <strong>"</strong><strong>People</strong> say now it's easier than in the past to get the local <strong>information</strong> they need, so we are not getting a <strong>signal</strong> in the <strong>questions</strong> about <strong>people</strong> thinking that data is hard to find. <strong>"</strong> 

 An <strong>uncertain future</strong> for local <strong>government <strong>information</strong></strong> 

 As <strong>print</strong> <strong>fades</strong> and a digital future for <strong><strong>news</strong></strong> becomes more equally distributed, <strong>establishing</strong> sustainable local <strong>online <strong>information</strong></strong> <strong>hubs</strong> to meet the <strong>information</strong> needs of our <strong>democracy</strong> will grow in <strong>importance</strong>, along with the <strong>means</strong> to connect those <strong><strong>news</strong></strong> <strong>sources</strong> to <strong>communities</strong> on the other <strong>side</strong> of the digital or data divide. Simply put, there's an increasing <strong>need</strong> for local <strong>government news</strong> to be generated from civic <strong>media</strong>, <strong>libraries</strong>, <strong>schools</strong>, <strong>institutions</strong> and private industry. <strong>New</strong> <strong>platforms</strong> for social <strong>networking</strong> and sharing still need to be supplied with accurate information. It's not clear if local <strong>governments</strong>, already stretched to provide essential <strong>services</strong>, will be able to become robust <strong>information</strong> providers. That said, new <strong>lightweight</strong> <strong>tools</strong> and <strong>platforms</strong> are enabling ambitious <strong>towns</strong> to go through " <strong>Gov</strong> 2.0 <strong>city</strong> makeovers . <strong>"</strong> 

 For now, <strong>citizens</strong> are not relying on local <strong>government</strong> to be their primary <strong>information</strong> providers. According to the <strong>report</strong>: 

 ... 3<strong>%</strong> of <strong>adults</strong> said that they rely on their local <strong><strong><strong>government</strong></strong></strong> (including both local <strong><strong><strong>government</strong></strong></strong> <strong>websites</strong> or visiting <strong>offices</strong> directly) as the main <strong><strong>source</strong></strong> of <strong>information</strong> for both <strong>taxes</strong> and for local social <strong>services</strong>, and even fewer cite their local <strong><strong><strong>government</strong></strong></strong> as a key <strong><strong>source</strong></strong> for other <strong>topics</strong> such as <strong>community</strong> <strong>events</strong>, zoning and <strong>development</strong>, and even local <strong><strong><strong>government</strong></strong></strong> activity. The <strong>results</strong> of the <strong>survey</strong> leave us with significant <strong>questions</strong> and, unfortunately, few <strong>answers</strong> about the <strong>future</strong> of <strong>news</strong> in rural <strong>areas</strong> and towns. While local <strong>TV</strong> <strong>stations</strong> can focus on their <strong>profit</strong> <strong>centers</strong> <strong>—</strong> <strong>weather</strong>, breaking <strong>news</strong>, <strong>crime</strong>, traffic <strong>—</strong> it's going to be tough for local <strong>papers</strong> to monetize the less popular but important <strong>coverage</strong> of civic affairs. <strong>"</strong><strong>Newspapers</strong> are not struggling in the <strong>information-dissemination part</strong> of their <strong>business</strong>,<strong>"</strong> said <strong>Rainie</strong> in our interview. <strong>"</strong>Indeed, other <strong>research</strong> shows many <strong>newspapers</strong> have a bigger <strong>audience</strong> than ever if you combine the <strong>print</strong> and <strong>web</strong> operations. <strong>"</strong> (<strong>Research</strong> <strong>data</strong> on the <strong>state</strong> of the <strong>media</strong> in 2011 may not fully support that contention. <strong>)</strong> 

 <strong>"</strong>But if <strong>newspapers</strong> cut back on <strong>coverage</strong> of local <strong>government</strong> because it is expensive and doesn't pay for itself with <strong>lots</strong> of <strong>advertising</strong>, then local <strong>government</strong> information will be harder to come by,<strong>"</strong> said Rainie. What these <strong>news consumption</strong> <strong>trends</strong> mean for local <strong>governments</strong>, in <strong>terms</strong> of getting <strong>information</strong> to <strong>citizens</strong> when and where they need it, is more difficult to judge. <strong>"</strong>The bigger <strong>issue</strong> that <strong>others</strong> have raised — notably by <strong>Steve Waldman</strong> at the <strong>FCC</strong> in his <strong>report</strong> [on the <strong>Information Needs</strong> of <strong>Communities</strong> <strong>"</strong>] — is who <strong>covers</strong> city <strong>hall</strong> and the <strong>school board</strong> and the <strong>zoning board</strong> to help make local institutions accountable? Our <strong>report</strong> raises that <strong>question</strong> without <strong>answering</strong> it," said Rainie. <strong>"</strong>If <strong>newspapers</strong> vanished, would TV <strong>stations</strong> or <strong>bloggers</strong> cover the bread-and-butter <strong>workings</strong> of local <strong>government</strong>, or do the <strong>kind</strong> of investigative <strong>pieces</strong> that <strong>newspapers</strong> have specialized in? We don't know and can't predict from these data. But it's an important question. <strong>"</strong> 

 <strong>Steve Coll</strong> published an <strong>article</strong> in the <strong>Columbia Journalism Review</strong> prior to <strong>Waldman</strong>'s that provided a thoughtful <strong>series</strong> of <strong>recommendations</strong> to reboot the news . Of the <strong>suggestions</strong> in the <strong><strong>FCC</strong></strong> <strong>report</strong> <strong>Rainie</strong> mentioned, perhaps the most important to the <strong>technology community</strong> was the <strong>recommendation</strong> to put more <strong>proceedings</strong>, <strong>documents</strong> and <strong><strong>data</strong></strong> online: "<strong>Governments</strong> at all <strong>levels</strong> should put far more <strong><strong>data</strong></strong> and <strong>information online</strong>, and do it in <strong>ways</strong> that are designed to be most useful," suggested the <strong><strong>FCC</strong></strong> in its <strong>report</strong>. <strong>"</strong><strong>Entrepreneurs</strong> can create new <strong>businesses</strong> and <strong>jobs</strong> based on <strong>distributing</strong>, shaping or analyzing this data. It will enable <strong>reporters</strong> to unearth <strong>stories</strong> in a <strong>day</strong> or two that might have previously taken two months. <strong>"</strong> 

 Notably, the <strong>Federal Trade Commission</strong> also has recommended <strong>publishing</strong> public <strong>data</strong> <strong>online</strong> to support the <strong>future</strong> of journalism . There is no <strong>shortage</strong> of creative <strong>ideas</strong> for the digital future of <strong>journalism</strong>, as evidenced by the <strong>conversations</strong> and new <strong>projects</strong> generated by the dynamic <strong>community</strong> that came together last <strong>weekend</strong> in <strong>Boston</strong> at the <strong>Online News Association</strong>'s annual conference. The <strong>challenge</strong> is that many of them supply <strong>information</strong> to digitally literate <strong>news</strong> <strong>consumers</strong> with <strong>smartphones</strong> and <strong>broadband</strong> connections, not the poor, undereducated or disconnected. If local <strong>newspapers</strong> go away and local <strong>government information</strong> all goes digital, with primary <strong>access</strong> through mobile <strong>devices</strong>, what will it mean for the 21<strong>%</strong> of Americans still offline? In <strong>addition</strong>, will being <strong>poor mean</strong> being uninformed and disconnected from local civic life? <strong><strong>"</strong></strong>In our <strong>data</strong>, <strong>people</strong> who are less well off are less connected,<strong><strong>"</strong></strong> said Rainie. <strong>"</strong>That makes it harder for them to use new <strong>tools</strong> for civic <strong>activism</strong> and to gather information easily and on-the-fly. <strong>"</strong> 

 <strong>Closing</strong> the civic <strong>gap</strong> 

 As <strong>citizens turns</strong> to the <strong>Internet</strong> for <strong><strong>government</strong> information</strong> , <strong>government</strong> <strong>entities</strong> have to respond on some level. At the local <strong>level</strong>, however, <strong>resources</strong> are scarce. Local <strong>TV news</strong> is unlikely to fill the <strong>gap</strong> left by local newspapers. The <strong>economics</strong> and the <strong>medium</strong> don't support using limited <strong>time</strong> to cover <strong>topics</strong> that aren't popular, as the <strong>report</strong> discusses: 

 Past <strong>PEJ</strong> <strong>studies</strong> have found that local <strong>newspapers</strong> typically have 70 to 100 <strong>stories</strong> a day. The typical half-hour local TV newscast is closer to 15. So it is logical that <strong>newspapers</strong> would offer <strong>coverage</strong> of more <strong>topics</strong> in a <strong>community</strong>, while <strong>television</strong> might concentrate on a more limited <strong>number</strong> that <strong>attract</strong> the widest audience. <strong>"</strong><strong>Local</strong> <strong>government</strong> is one <strong>coverage area</strong> that will suffer immensely if daily <strong>newspapers</strong> go under,<strong>"</strong> commented <strong>Owen Covington</strong> , a <strong>reporter</strong> for The <strong>Triad Business Journal</strong> in <strong>North Carolina</strong>, in <strong>response</strong> to  <strong>"</strong>>my <strong>question</strong> on Google+ . "It can be mundane, but is necessary, and time-consuming to produce. Daily <strong>newspapers</strong> cover local <strong>government</strong> as a <strong>matter</strong> of <strong>course</strong>, while much of the <strong>online coverage</strong> from other <strong>sources</strong> is sporadic, and often opinionated and lacking depth. I'm not saying there aren't <strong>alternatives</strong> that do as good or better a <strong>job</strong> than the daily <strong>print</strong> <strong>editions</strong>, but they are still rather rare and <strong>absent</strong> in most <strong>communities</strong> now served by dailies. <strong>"</strong> 

 The <strong>Pew</strong> <strong>report</strong> found that citizen-produced information (e.g. <strong><strong>news</strong>letters</strong> or <strong>listservs</strong>), commercial <strong>websites</strong> and <strong><strong>news</strong>papers</strong> all outweighed local <strong>government</strong> as <strong>news</strong> <strong>sources</strong> that readers relied upon. In that <strong>context</strong>, the <strong>work</strong> of e-democracy.org and other civic media platforms will be critical. There are a growing <strong>number</strong> of free or inexpensive web-based <strong>tools</strong> available to <strong>city</strong> <strong>managers</strong>, including a growing <strong>repository</strong> of open <strong>source civic software</strong> at <strong>Civic</strong> Commons . Another <strong>direction</strong> <strong>lies</strong> in the <strong>use</strong> of local <strong>wikis</strong> to connect communities. <strong>Libraries</strong> will be important <strong>hubs</strong> for rural <strong>communities</strong> and will be a <strong>core element</strong> of bridging the digital <strong>divide</strong> in under-connected <strong>communities</strong>. <strong>Listservs</strong> will play a <strong>role</strong> in <strong>connecting</strong> <strong>citizens</strong> using the <strong>Internet</strong>'s original <strong>killer app</strong>, email. <strong>Platforms</strong> for <strong>participatory</strong> budgeting may be integrated into <strong>hubs</strong> in <strong>municipalities</strong> that have a <strong>tolerance</strong> for <strong>ceding</strong> more <strong>power</strong> of the <strong>purse</strong> directly to citizens. <strong>"</strong>I would suggest that many of the citizen-powered <strong>information</strong> <strong>systems</strong> will not look like a <strong>newspaper website</strong>,<strong>"</strong> commented <strong>Jeff Sonderman</strong>, a digital <strong>media</strong> fellow at The <strong>Poynter Institute</strong> for <strong>Media</strong> <strong>Studies</strong>, when asked for his <strong>opinion</strong>, fittingly, in a <strong>Facebook</strong> <strong>group</strong> on social journalism. It's "more likely to be <strong>message</strong> <strong>boards</strong>, <strong>Facebook</strong> <strong>groups</strong> or <strong>email</strong> listservs. <strong>"</strong> 

 Many forward-thinking local <strong>governments</strong> will provide the <strong>means</strong> for <strong>citizens</strong> to obtain <strong>information</strong> by using the most common electronic <strong>device</strong>: a cellphone. <strong>Arkansas</strong>, for <strong>instance</strong>, has added <strong>question</strong> and <strong>answer functionality</strong> to mobile <strong>apps</strong> for <strong>citizens</strong> using text messaging. Should small <strong>cities</strong> or <strong>towns</strong> invest in citizen engagement? The <strong>government-as-a-platform approach</strong> <strong>looks</strong> to <strong>nonprofits</strong>, civic <strong>coders</strong>, <strong>educators</strong>, <strong>media</strong>, concerned <strong>citizens</strong> and commercial <strong>interests</strong> to fill that <strong>gap</strong>, <strong>building</strong> upon the <strong>core web</strong> <strong>services</strong> and data governments can provide. An <strong>essay</strong> on <strong>newspapers</strong> and <strong><strong>government</strong></strong> 2.0 published earlier this <strong>year</strong> by <strong>Pete Peterson</strong>, a <strong>professor</strong> at <strong>Pepperdine University</strong>, explored the potential for <strong>media</strong> and local <strong><strong>government</strong></strong> to collaborate on <strong>citizen engagement</strong>: 

 The increasing <strong>use</strong> of these <strong>tools</strong> by local and <strong>state</strong> <strong><strong>government</strong></strong>s has created a <strong>niche</strong> within the <strong>burgeoning</strong> " <strong>Gov</strong> 2.0 <strong>field</strong>," which now covers <strong>enterprises</strong> from participatory policy making to 311-systems. Although <strong><strong><strong>news</strong>papers</strong></strong> have been slower to employ these <strong>online engagement</strong> <strong>platforms</strong>, several interesting <strong>initiatives</strong> launched by <strong><strong><strong>news</strong>papers</strong></strong> from the <strong>San Francisco Chronicle</strong> and its <strong>water shortage game</strong> to the <strong>Washington Post</strong>'s <strong>city budget</strong> balancing <strong>tool indicate</strong> that <strong>news</strong> <strong>organizations</strong> are beginning to take the <strong>lead</strong> in online public participation. This can be seen as both good and bad. On the positive <strong>side</strong>, these <strong>tools</strong> are interactive, allowing a new and <strong>participatory form</strong> of <strong>learning</strong> for participants. Matched with the <strong>popularity</strong> of <strong><strong>online</strong></strong> <strong>games</strong> in general, these <strong><strong>online</strong></strong> civic <strong>engagement</strong> <strong>platforms</strong> can create a real <strong><strong>"</strong></strong>win-win<strong><strong>"</strong></strong> for both <strong>news</strong> <strong>organizations</strong> and <strong>users</strong> alike — informing <strong>readers</strong> and driving precious <strong><strong>online</strong></strong> traffic to <strong>news</strong>paper websites. To <strong>date</strong>, however, that <strong>kind</strong> of <strong>cooperation</strong> doesn't appear to be gathering much <strong>momentum</strong> as a <strong>complement</strong> to the <strong>press</strong> looking for <strong>fraud</strong>, <strong>corruption</strong> or scandal. And, as <strong>Peterson</strong> noted, there are other <strong>challenges</strong> for the <strong>media</strong>: 

 The <strong>way</strong> to build the most effective <strong>online engagement</strong> <strong>platforms</strong> is for <strong>news</strong> <strong>organizations</strong> and local <strong>governments</strong> to collaborate from their <strong>strengths</strong>: <strong>news</strong>papers bringing their informed <strong>readership</strong> and <strong>marketing</strong> <strong>skills</strong>, working with a <strong>municipality</strong>'s <strong>budget</strong> and <strong>policy</strong> experts. Of <strong>course</strong>, these <strong>relationships</strong> <strong>demand</strong> both <strong>transparency</strong> and a <strong>lack</strong> of <strong>bias</strong> — <strong>qualities</strong> neither party is known for. But — and this may be hardest of all — these <strong>tools</strong> also need <strong>citizens</strong> who are both engaged on local <strong>issues</strong> and humble about the <strong>challenges</strong> of forming public policy. The <strong>growth</strong> of a new <strong>digital news ecosystem</strong> populated by civic <strong>media</strong> , an <strong>evolving civic stack</strong> , and <strong>data</strong> <strong>journalism</strong> will generate some <strong>answers</strong> to these <strong>questions</strong>, but it won't address all of the outstanding issues. Local <strong>news</strong> <strong><strong>readers</strong></strong> write in 

 When I asked for <strong>feedback</strong> from <strong><strong>readers</strong></strong> on <strong>Twitter</strong>, Google+ and <strong>Facebook</strong>, I received a wide <strong>range</strong> of <strong>responses</strong> , some expressing serious <strong>worries</strong> about the <strong>future</strong> of local <strong>journalism</strong> and a few that were hopeful about the <strong>potential</strong> for <strong>technology</strong> to help citizens inform one another. A <strong>number</strong> of <strong>people</strong> discussed new public and private <strong>ventures</strong>, including <strong>Patch.com</strong> , <strong>AOL</strong>'s initiative to fill the <strong>gap</strong> in local <strong>news</strong>, and <strong>NPR</strong>'s <strong>Project Argo</strong> , which is experimenting with regional <strong>news</strong> coverage through public radio. <strong>"</strong>I expect <strong>people</strong> will come together in <strong>groups</strong> or <strong>neighborhoods</strong>, and <strong>things</strong> will be more fluid,<strong>"</strong> commented <strong>David Johnson</strong>, a <strong>journalism professor</strong> at American <strong>University</strong>, in <strong>response</strong> to my <strong>question</strong> on Facebook . <strong>"</strong>I don't foresee commercially supported <strong>news</strong> and <strong>information</strong> on the local <strong>level</strong> until there is a valuable <strong>platform</strong> for <strong>advertising</strong> and <strong>exchange</strong> of various <strong>level</strong>s of services. Perhaps associations will fill the void. <strong>"</strong> 

 The <strong>"</strong>loss of local <strong>newspapers</strong>, <strong>dailies</strong> or <strong>weeklies</strong>, is not a new <strong><strong>concern</strong></strong>, and a <strong><strong>concern</strong></strong> in <strong>metropolitan</strong> as well as more rural <strong>cities</strong> and <strong>towns</strong>,<strong>"</strong> commented <strong>Robert Petersen</strong> , a <strong>software developer</strong>, in <strong>response</strong> to my <strong>question</strong> on Google+. <strong>Petersen</strong> continued: 

 Many <strong>years</strong> ago the early <strong>trend</strong> in smaller <strong>markets</strong> was <strong>loss</strong> of local <strong>ownership</strong> of both <strong>print</strong> and broadcast <strong>news</strong> <strong>sources</strong>, an <strong>event</strong> that <strong>leads</strong> to a <strong>focus</strong> on financial <strong>performance</strong> first, rather than the financial <strong>success</strong> that follows from producing a quality product. More recently the <strong>advertising</strong> <strong>dollars</strong> necessary to sustain local <strong><strong>journalism</strong></strong> have tended to flow away from local <strong><strong>journalism</strong></strong> <strong>outlets</strong> to the additional <strong>delivery</strong> <strong>mechanisms</strong>, including <strong>"</strong><strong>shoppers</strong><strong>"</strong> (those <strong>go way</strong> back), electronic (direct email, <strong>blogs</strong>, <strong>coupon</strong> or <strong>deal</strong> <strong><strong>sites</strong></strong>, shopping <strong>help</strong> <strong><strong>sites</strong></strong> with <strong>reviews</strong> and <strong>price</strong> <strong>comparisons</strong>, etc. <strong>)</strong>, <strong>movement</strong> of <strong>advertising</strong> to regional <strong>radio</strong> and <strong>TV</strong>, not to mention the <strong>loss</strong> of local <strong>sales</strong> to online merchants. This <strong>shift</strong> away from local <strong><strong><strong>journalism</strong></strong></strong> can also be seen in the <strong><strong><strong>journalism</strong></strong></strong> <strong>schools</strong>, where <strong>students</strong> are much more interested in <strong><strong><strong>journalism</strong></strong></strong> with perceived better financial prospects. That there can be substantial non-financial <strong>benefits</strong> to living in small <strong>cities</strong> and <strong>towns</strong>, <strong>i.e.</strong>, <strong>quality</strong> of <strong>life</strong>, seems of less importance. I fear losing the <strong>judgment</strong>, <strong>ethics</strong>, and <strong>dedication</strong> of small-town <strong>journalists</strong> will lead to a slow <strong>deterioration</strong> of the <strong><strong>quality</strong></strong> of local <strong>government</strong>, a <strong>reduction</strong> in the <strong><strong>quality</strong></strong> of <strong>life</strong> due to a <strong>lack</strong> of balanced <strong>reporting</strong> (as well as <strong>editorials</strong>) of local <strong>issues</strong>, and in too many <strong>places</strong> a <strong>return</strong> to the civic <strong>leaders</strong> in the <strong>"</strong>smoke-filled <strong>room</strong><strong>"</strong> making decisions for the uninformed. <strong>Jeanne Holm</strong>, <strong>Data.gov</strong>'s open <strong>data</strong> evangelist, shared her <strong>community</strong>'s hybrid <strong>news reality</strong> in a <strong>reply</strong> to my <strong>question</strong> on Google+ : 

 <strong>In</strong> my small <strong>town</strong> in <strong>Southern California</strong>, we still <strong>support</strong> a local <strong>paper</strong>, but the frequency has changed. We supplement with <strong>online news</strong> from <strong>City Hall</strong>, and most importantly we use social <strong>media</strong> — a lot. We have <strong>fires</strong> and <strong>floods</strong> in our <strong>area</strong>, and <strong>everyone</strong> <strong>connects</strong> on <strong>Facebook</strong> and via our <strong>emergency website</strong> to get <strong>people</strong> organized, <strong>supplies</strong> where needed, and our <strong>firefighters</strong> the support they need. It works really well. The local reporters often lead those social media conversations. They are reporting, but just in <strong>multiple</strong> <strong>modalities</strong> and in <strong>ways</strong> that make <strong>sense</strong> to the situation. <strong>"</strong> 

 If <strong>states</strong> are the <strong>laboratories</strong> for <strong>democracy</strong> , towns and <strong>cities</strong> may be the <strong>Petri</strong> dishes that <strong>stress test</strong> the <strong>vitality</strong> of different <strong>species</strong> of <strong>online</strong> hubs. The <strong>ones</strong> that will stick around will have met the <strong>information</strong> needs of <strong>citizens</strong> better than the <strong>alternatives</strong> — or they'll have found sustainable <strong>business</strong> models. In an ideal world, they'll have both. Appropriately, the <strong>conversation</strong> around the <strong>Pew</strong> <strong>report</strong> continues on a <strong>variety</strong> of <strong>online</strong> forums. If you have any <strong>thoughts</strong> on what's next, <strong>please feel</strong> free to share them in the <strong>comments</strong> here or on Google+ and <strong>Facebook</strong> , and via the #<strong>localnews</strong> hashtag on Twitter . <strong>Photo</strong>: 03.Newspapers.SW.WDC.22dec05 by <strong>ElvertBarnes</strong>, on Flickr
