    <body>Medical <strong>devices</strong>, as I reported earlier this <strong>month</strong> , are becoming more and more important to <strong>health care</strong> as they get more sophisticated, more compact, cheaper, and easier to deploy in the home. But in <strong>addition</strong> to improving <strong>care</strong>, keeping <strong>patients</strong> out of the hospital, and providing useful clinical <strong>data</strong> to <strong>researchers</strong>, could medical <strong>devices</strong> help with one of the biggest <strong>contributors</strong> to escalating <strong>health</strong> costs--could they help prevent fraud? <strong>Fraud</strong> is definitely sucking <strong>money</strong> from the health care system. The <strong>Coalition Against Insurance Fraud (</strong>while cautioning that accurate <strong>statistics</strong> are hard to gather) estimated that <strong>Medicare</strong> and <strong>Medicaid</strong> made an estimated 23.7 billion <strong>dollars</strong> in <strong>improper</strong> payments in 2007. The <strong>Wall Street Journal</strong> just reported the <strong>conviction</strong> of a single <strong>scam</strong> that <strong>cost</strong> <strong>Medicare</strong> 205 million dollars . <strong>Governments</strong> aren't the only <strong>ones</strong> paying bad claims. Private <strong>insurers</strong> are obsessed with <strong>fraudulent</strong> charges. And all payers--both <strong>government</strong> and private--put up huge bureaucratic <strong>barriers</strong> to <strong>payments</strong> in <strong>order</strong> to combat <strong>fraud</strong>, elevating <strong>health</strong> costs even more. <strong>Deliberate</strong> <strong>charges</strong> for <strong>work</strong> that was never performed <strong>represent</strong> the <strong>extreme end</strong> of a <strong>range</strong> of poor medical practices. <strong>Medicare</strong> <strong>defines</strong> a <strong>category</strong> of <strong>"</strong><strong>abuse</strong><strong>"</strong> in addition to fraud . <strong>Examples</strong> of <strong>abuse include</strong> performing an unnecessary <strong>procedure</strong> and <strong>offering</strong> <strong>treatments</strong> in an ineffective manner. What can medical devices do? As <strong>developer</strong> <strong>Shahid Shah</strong> pointed out in an <strong>interview</strong> , <strong>devices</strong> provide authoritative <strong>information</strong> that is more accurate than <strong>impressions</strong> reported by either <strong>patients</strong> or <strong>health care</strong> providers. This means they can objectively indicate: 

 

 

 <strong><strong>Traits</strong></strong> and <strong><strong><strong>statistics</strong></strong></strong> indicating the <strong>presence</strong> of <strong>diseases</strong> and medical conditions 

  

 <strong><strong>Traits</strong></strong> and <strong><strong><strong>statistics</strong></strong></strong> indicating that <strong>treatments</strong> were applied 

  

 <strong><strong>Traits</strong></strong> and <strong><strong><strong>statistics</strong></strong></strong> indicating the <strong>remission</strong> of <strong>symptoms</strong> 

 

 

 

 In other <strong>words</strong>, <strong>evidence</strong> from <strong>devices</strong> can verify that a treatment was necessary, that it was administered, and that it was effective. To carry out their <strong>role</strong> in <strong>fraud prevention</strong>, devices must be secured. When a <strong><strong>manufacturer</strong></strong>'s <strong>testing</strong> <strong>verifies</strong> their <strong>accuracy</strong>, the <strong><strong>manufacturer</strong></strong> should digitally sign them, and each <strong>transmission</strong> from the <strong>device</strong> should bear the signature. Tampering should, as much as the manufacturer can guarantee, disable the digital signature. <strong>Analysis</strong> may also be able to detect other <strong>ways</strong> of gaming the <strong>system</strong>, such as <strong>patients</strong> creating artificial <strong>conditions</strong> to simulate medical problems.</body>
