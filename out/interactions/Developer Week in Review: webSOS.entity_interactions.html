    <body>On the <strong>developer front</strong>, if the growing <strong>tide</strong> of <strong>rumors</strong> is correct, there will be some <strong>iOS</strong> <strong>stuff</strong> to report next week. Meanwhile: 

 Last one out <strong>turn</strong> off the <strong>lights</strong> 

 <strong>HP</strong> has flung the <strong>axe</strong>, and it has taken out a large <strong>swath</strong> of the ill-fated <strong>webOS</strong> crew. <strong>HP</strong> is confirming that <strong>development</strong> will cease by the <strong>end</strong> of the <strong>year</strong>, reducing the <strong>number</strong> of viable mobile <strong>operating</strong> <strong>systems</strong> down to two again (<strong>Blackberry</strong> is heading the <strong>way</strong> of <strong>webOS</strong>, and <strong>Windows Mobile</strong> has an <strong>uphill battle</strong> at this point). Is hegemony in the mobile space a good thing? Maybe, maybe not. It's good for mobile <strong>developers</strong>, as it reduces the <strong>number</strong> of potential platforms you need to consider. It could be bad for <strong>consumers</strong>, as it reduces the <strong>pressure</strong> on the remaining players to innovate. However, given that neither <strong>HP</strong> nor <strong>Microsoft</strong> nor <strong>RIM</strong> was pushing the <strong>envelope</strong> much with their <strong>products</strong>, that might not be a valid concern. And, frankly, <strong>Google</strong> and <strong>Apple</strong> do a pretty good <strong>job</strong> of stealing <strong>ideas</strong> from each other <strong>â€” witness</strong> the new Android-like <strong>notification framework</strong> in iOS5. <strong>Android Open</strong> , being held <strong>October</strong> 9-11 in <strong>San Francisco</strong>, is a big-tent <strong>meeting ground</strong> for <strong>app</strong> and <strong>game</strong> <strong>developers</strong>, <strong>carriers</strong>, <strong>chip</strong> <strong>manufacturers</strong>, <strong>content</strong> <strong>creators</strong>, <strong>OEMs</strong>, <strong>researchers</strong>, <strong>entrepreneurs</strong>, <strong>VCs</strong>, and <strong>business</strong> leaders. <strong>Save</strong> 20<strong>%</strong> on <strong>registration</strong> with the <strong>code</strong> AN11RAD 

 An (<strong>un</strong>)<strong>sign</strong> of the <strong>times</strong> 

 One of the <strong>joys</strong> of <strong>Java</strong> <strong>development</strong> is dealing with <strong>sign</strong>ed jars. For the uninitiated, <strong>Java Archives (</strong>jars) can be signed, <strong>"</strong><strong>proving</strong><strong>"</strong> that the contents inside are valid and untampered. Among other <strong>things</strong>, it is how the <strong><strong>Java</strong> Web Start</strong> <strong>framework</strong> decides which <strong>Java</strong> <strong>programs</strong> can be automatically downloaded and started from a web page. Getting your <strong>jar file</strong> signed correctly is a <strong>delicate dance</strong>, and getting it wrong <strong>means</strong> that the applications will just plain not work. Seemingly out of the blue, <strong>Oracle</strong> has started to remove the old <strong>Sun</strong> <strong>signatures</strong> from some <strong>core</strong> <strong>Java</strong> <strong>libraries</strong> that many developers depend on. The <strong>end result</strong> of this is that, going forward, it will become more difficult to deploy <strong>applications</strong> that <strong>use</strong> these frameworks. <strong><strong>Oracle</strong></strong> is saying it was done for <strong>security</strong> <strong>reasons</strong>, but as with many <strong>moves</strong> by <strong><strong>Oracle</strong></strong> lately, the <strong>end result</strong> has been to upset the developer community. Creating the next generation of coders? One of the paradoxical <strong>phenomena</strong> that seems to be occurring in <strong>society</strong> is that, even as <strong>technology</strong> is becoming more and more a <strong>part</strong> of <strong>people</strong>'s <strong>lives</strong>, programming is being marginalized in the <strong>public</strong> schools. Instead, <strong><strong>kid</strong>s</strong> are taught how to use <strong>Excel</strong> or <strong><strong>Powerpoint</strong></strong> (<strong>God</strong> knows, my <strong>kid</strong> is a <strong><strong>Powerpoint</strong></strong> wiz!). In the <strong>UK</strong>, they've decided to turn <strong>things</strong> around by making <strong>software design</strong> a <strong>part</strong> of the curriculum. You can make a strong <strong>argument</strong> that <strong>software</strong> engineering <strong>brings</strong> in <strong>skills</strong> from a <strong>lot</strong> of other <strong>disciplines</strong> like <strong>math</strong> and <strong>science</strong>, so it makes a good integrated teaching experience. On the other <strong>hand</strong>, my <strong>experience</strong> has been that public <strong>schools</strong> are uniquely bad at <strong>teaching</strong> coding because they try to teach it by <strong>rote</strong>, when it is at <strong>heart</strong> a creative process. It's like trying to teach <strong>painting</strong> by <strong>telling</strong> the <strong>students</strong> exactly where to place every brush stroke. Only time will tell if the UK can do it any better. Got news? <strong>Please</strong> send <strong>tips</strong> and leads here . Related:
