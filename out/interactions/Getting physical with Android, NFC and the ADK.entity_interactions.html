    <body><strong>Android</strong> is rapidly extending beyond the <strong>phone</strong> and becoming a <strong>hardware hub</strong>, with <strong>capabilities</strong> that allow a wide <strong>range</strong> of <strong>applications</strong> and <strong>interface</strong> possibilities. <strong>Features</strong> like Near Field Communication (NFC) and the Open Accessory Development Kit (ADK) are opening new <strong>arenas</strong> for developers. Brian <strong>Jepson ( @</strong><strong>bjepson</strong> ) is an O'Reilly <strong>editor</strong> and <strong>hardware hacker</strong> who's recently been focusing on making <strong>things</strong> with <strong>technologies</strong> like <strong>Arduino</strong> and Android. <strong>Jepson</strong> and <strong>Tyler Moskowite ( @</strong><strong>tmoskowite</strong> ), a <strong>programmer</strong> and <strong>engineering intern</strong> at <strong>Make Magazine</strong>, will be presenting a <strong>workshop</strong> on <strong>" Getting Physical</strong> with <strong>Android</strong>: <strong>Open</strong> <strong>Accessories</strong> & <strong>NFC "</strong> at the <strong>upcoming</strong> <strong>Android</strong> <strong>Open</strong> Conference . I recently spoke to <strong>Jepson</strong> and <strong>Moskowite</strong> about the <strong>convergence</strong> of <strong><strong>Android</strong></strong> and <strong>hardware</strong> hacking, and what it might mean for the <strong><strong>Android</strong></strong> ecosystem. Our interview follows. What does <strong>Android</strong>'s <strong>openness allow</strong> developers to do? Brian <strong>Jepson</strong>: I think the biggest <strong>thing</strong> is that it allows developers to experiment. On <strong>iOS</strong>, you have to spend <strong>money</strong> to even deploy <strong>apps</strong> to a phone that you own. And unless you put an <strong>app</strong> in the <strong>App Store</strong> or <strong>sign</strong> up for the <strong>Enterprise</strong> or <strong>Academic</strong> <strong>programs</strong>, you can only distribute <strong>app</strong>s to 100 devices total. It's cumbersome. I love that you can <strong>"</strong>sideload<strong>"</strong> <strong><strong>app</strong>s</strong> on <strong>Android</strong>: make an <strong>app</strong>, <strong>distribute</strong> it outside the <strong>Android</strong> Market, and people can use it. <strong>Tyler Moskowite</strong>: <strong>Allowing</strong> <strong>developers</strong> to reproduce their own <strong><strong>versions</strong></strong> of the <strong>Android</strong> <strong>operating system</strong> has resulted in many <strong>custom</strong> <strong><strong>versions</strong></strong> of <strong>Android</strong>. The most notable one is <strong>Cyanogen Mod</strong> , which provides the <strong>base</strong> for <strong>lots</strong> of <strong>custom</strong> <strong>Android</strong> systems. What <strong>kinds</strong> of <strong>things</strong> are <strong>makers</strong> building with <strong>NFC</strong>, the <strong>Accessory Development Kit</strong>, and Arduino? Brian <strong>Jepson</strong>: I haven't seen much being <strong>done</strong> with <strong>NFC</strong>, though I did a <strong>wacky demo</strong> with it that involved <strong>Processing</strong>, <strong>Arduino</strong>, and Twitter. But there have been <strong>lots</strong> of cool <strong>things</strong> <strong>done</strong> with the ADK. I've seen <strong>everything</strong> from tablet-controlled <strong>dancing</strong> <strong>robots</strong> to a cell-phone-controlled <strong>ball maze</strong> inspired by the life-size <strong>labyrinth</strong> at Google I/O . There have been interesting <strong>projects</strong> going on with <strong>Arduino</strong> since before the ADK. In <strong>fact</strong>, I built a <strong>variation</strong> on <strong>Tero</strong> and <strong>Kimmo Karvinen</strong>'s <strong>Soccer Playing Robot (</strong>from <strong>Make</strong>: <strong>Arduino</strong> <strong>Bots</strong> and <strong>Gadgets</strong> ) and brought it to Google I/O. This combined <strong>Android</strong> and <strong>Arduino</strong>, but they communicated over <strong>Bluetooth</strong> instead of a cable, the <strong>way</strong> the ADK currently works. <strong>Tero</strong> and <strong>Kimmo</strong>'s <strong>robot</strong> is one of my favorite <strong>Android/Arduino</strong> projects. <strong>Amarino</strong> is also very cool, though it's more of a <strong>platform</strong> for <strong>connecting</strong> <strong>Arduino</strong> and Android. How big a <strong>problem</strong> is <strong>fragmentation</strong> in the <strong>Android</strong> ecosystem? Brian <strong>Jepson</strong>: It's more noticeable to me because I work with <strong>things</strong> like <strong>NFC</strong> and <strong>ADK</strong> that <strong>require</strong> a very recent <strong>version</strong> of Android. I don't know how big a <strong>deal</strong> it is for <strong>lots</strong> of other folks. I can look at the fragmentation dashboard , and yeah, it's not pretty. At least Android 2.x is dominating. But it's a <strong>problem</strong> and a <strong>headache</strong> for developers. I figure Google can mitigate the problem, but I don't see them ever making it go away. <strong>Tell</strong> us a little about the <strong>Mini Maker Faire</strong> <strong>event</strong> at Android Open. What kind of makers are you looking for? Brian <strong>Jepson</strong>: We are looking for <strong>anyone</strong> who has made <strong>something cool</strong> using <strong>Android</strong> and related technologies. We'd love to have a broad <strong>spectrum</strong> of <strong>crafts</strong>, <strong>electronics</strong>, robots, and so forth. <strong>Android Open</strong> , being held <strong>October</strong> 9-11 in <strong>San Francisco</strong>, is a big-tent <strong>meeting ground</strong> for <strong>app</strong> and <strong>game</strong> <strong>developers</strong>, <strong>carriers</strong>, <strong>chip</strong> <strong>manufacturers</strong>, <strong>content</strong> <strong>creators</strong>, <strong>OEMs</strong>, <strong>researchers</strong>, <strong>entrepreneurs</strong>, <strong>VCs</strong>, and <strong>business</strong> leaders. <strong>Save</strong> 20<strong>%</strong> on <strong>registration</strong> with the <strong>code</strong> AN11RAD
