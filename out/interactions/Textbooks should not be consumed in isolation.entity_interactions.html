    <body>This <strong>post</strong> is <strong>part</strong> of the <strong>TOC</strong> <strong>podcast</strong> <strong>series</strong> , which we'll be featuring here on <strong>Radar</strong> in the coming months. <strong>Textbook</strong> <strong>publisher</strong> <strong>Inkling</strong> recently published its 51st <strong>textbook</strong> for the iPad. <strong>Company founder</strong> and <strong>CEO Matt MacInnis ( @</strong><strong>stanine</strong> ) recently sat down with O'Reilly's <strong>Joe Wikert</strong> to talk about the <strong>company</strong> and how its <strong>goals</strong> go <strong>way</strong> beyond traditional textbook education. <strong>Highlights</strong> from the <strong>interview include</strong>: 

 
 <strong>Textbook</strong> <strong>design</strong> is going to change — "We don't think the <strong><strong>products</strong> people</strong> pay for a few <strong>years</strong> from now are going to be as distinct as the <strong>textbook</strong> is <strong>today</strong> from other <strong>print</strong> <strong>products</strong> ... when you think about learning about cellular <strong>biology</strong> or <strong>something</strong> medical, or you think about learning how to crochet or cook or <strong>travel</strong> — a <strong>lot</strong> of those <strong>products</strong> are going to start to look much more similar. They're going to be more modular or they're going to be more hierarchical — they're going to be more interactive. Although our <strong>focus today</strong> is most certainly on the <strong>textbook</strong>, there's a whole <strong>world</strong> of <strong>opportunity</strong> for this <strong>kind</strong> of technology. " [Discussed at the 1:51 mark . <strong>]</strong> 

 The <strong>way</strong> text<strong>book</strong>s are consumed is going to change — "When you think about the <strong>chapter</strong>, it is a <strong>division</strong> of <strong><strong>content</strong></strong> that's really rooted in the <strong>structure</strong> of the <strong>book</strong> ... [We think that as we work with <strong>publishers</strong><strong>]</strong> to build natively digital <strong><strong>content</strong></strong>, you won't have a <strong>chapter</strong>. You'll actually have an <strong>object</strong> or you'll have <strong>something</strong> that is learning- and outcome-focused that you'll pay for as a modular <strong>bit</strong> of content. " [Discussed at 4:13 . <strong>]</strong> 

 <strong>Social</strong> <strong>features</strong> work particularly well with <strong>textbooks</strong> — "<strong>Human</strong> beings are wired to learn from one another. The <strong><strong>textbook</strong></strong> is a fundamentally isolating <strong>experience</strong>, and sometimes that's good ... but with a <strong><strong>textbook</strong></strong> it's not such a great <strong>thing</strong> to be totally isolated from the world around you. It's <strong>okay</strong> to focus, but you also need to bounce <strong>ideas</strong> off <strong>people</strong> and ask <strong>questions</strong> and have <strong>people</strong> show you things you don't understand. Our <strong>goal</strong> is to bring the <strong>community</strong> of <strong>learners</strong> around you into the <strong>textbook experience</strong> so that the <strong>content</strong> is one of the <strong>ways</strong> you learn when you're using Inkling. " [Discussed at 7:30 . <strong>]</strong>
