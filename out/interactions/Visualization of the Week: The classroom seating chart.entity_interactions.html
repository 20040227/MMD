    <body><strong>School</strong> is back in <strong>session</strong> for most <strong>college</strong> <strong>students</strong>, and by now many have chosen the <strong>seats</strong> they plan to occupy for the <strong>rest</strong> of the semester. Of <strong>course</strong>, where you choose to sit <strong>depends</strong> on a <strong>number</strong> of <strong>factors</strong>: the <strong>size</strong> of the <strong>class</strong>, the <strong>layout</strong> of the <strong>seats</strong>, the <strong>friends</strong> you have or make there, and your <strong>preference</strong> for the <strong>front</strong> or the <strong>back</strong> of the room. <strong>Software development</strong> and <strong>design company</strong> <strong>Skyrill</strong> has created a <strong>visualization</strong> of the <strong>seating</strong> habits of a graduate-level <strong>class</strong> at MIT. It shows that these particular students tend to move around quite a bit. <strong>Screenshot</strong> of <strong>Skyrill</strong>'s "Classroom <strong>seating</strong> habits" visualization. The top of the <strong>visualization</strong> shows the <strong>front</strong> of the classroom. <strong>Circle</strong> sizes <strong>represent</strong> how often a <strong>student</strong> sat in a particular seat. Click to see the full interactive version . The top of the <strong>visualization</strong> shows the <strong>front</strong> of the classroom, and it moves back from there. The larger the <strong>circle</strong>, the more often a <strong>student</strong> has sat in that seat. The interactive <strong>visualization</strong> <strong>lets</strong> you select different <strong>numbers</strong> of <strong>students</strong>, and you can animate it to see where they sat throughout the semester. You can also choose to focus on those <strong>students</strong> who chose to sit in the same "zone" or those who moved around a lot. The <strong>visualization</strong> was created using <strong>d3</strong> and jQuery. <strong>(</strong>Hat <strong>tip</strong> to Flowing Data . )
