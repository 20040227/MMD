    <body>If you haven't noticed, creating and executing mobile platform plays is really hard. Just ask <strong>HP</strong>, <strong>RIM</strong>, <strong>Nokia</strong> and Microsoft. Even <strong>Google</strong>'s <strong>Android</strong>, which made it look easy to grab dominant <strong>market share</strong> in the <strong>smartphone market</strong>, is finding it much harder to secure a <strong>footprint</strong> in the <strong>tablet market</strong>, where, let's <strong>face</strong> it, there's <strong>iPad</strong> ... and <strong>iPad</strong>. <strong>Enter Amazon</strong>, whose <strong>forthcoming</strong> <strong>Kindle Tablet</strong> represents the clearest <strong>alternative</strong> to <strong>Apple</strong>'s iPad. Securing the <strong>design win</strong> 

 I once co-founded a <strong>device management platform company</strong> in the embedded <strong>systems</strong> <strong>space</strong> ( <strong>Rapid Logic )</strong> where we came to define three <strong>core</strong> <strong>precepts</strong> for succeeding in a platform-oriented <strong>business</strong>: 

 
 <strong>Secure</strong> the <strong>design win</strong>. <strong>Grow</strong> the <strong>dollars</strong> associated with the <strong>runtime</strong> (via <strong>royalties</strong> or new <strong>product</strong> add-ons). Get the customer to want to embed themselves more deeply. <strong>Flash</strong> forward to the <strong>present</strong> and we see a post-PC <strong>device market</strong> emerging that has revealed some interesting attributes. For one, we see how the carrier-dependent <strong>mobile phone segment</strong> logically bifurcates between the <strong>Apple</strong> <strong><strong>approach</strong></strong> (vertical <strong>integration</strong>) and the <strong>Android</strong> <strong><strong>approach</strong></strong> (horizontal, loose coupling). Why is this so? For the simple <strong>reason</strong> that for a large <strong>portion</strong> of the <strong>market</strong>, <strong>carrier</strong> "<strong>push</strong>" via <strong>phone pricing</strong> — plus a <strong>subsidy</strong> combined with a retail <strong>presence</strong> — <strong>dictates</strong> buying <strong>patterns</strong> every <strong>bit</strong> as much as <strong>product positioning</strong> and differentiation. Most fundamentally, this is because <strong>regardless</strong> of whether the <strong>end <strong><strong>phone</strong></strong></strong> is an <strong>iPhone</strong> or an <strong>Android</strong> <strong><strong>phone</strong></strong>, A<strong>)</strong> the <strong>buyer</strong> is already a mobile <strong><strong>phone</strong></strong> subscriber, and B<strong>)</strong> either <strong><strong>phone</strong></strong> <strong>represents</strong> a <strong>step</strong> up from traditional <strong>feature</strong> <strong><strong>phone</strong></strong>s. However, when we move into tablet-style <strong><strong><strong>device</strong></strong>s</strong>, <strong>ebook</strong> and <strong>media</strong> <strong><strong>device</strong></strong> <strong>players</strong>, where the alternative is non-consumption <strong>(</strong><strong>i.e.</strong>, buying no <strong><strong>device</strong></strong>), it becomes clear that the <strong>breadth</strong> and <strong>depth</strong> of ecosystem orchestration that is required goes up materially. This is why <strong><strong>Android</strong></strong> has not yet found a <strong>foothold</strong> in the <strong>tablet market</strong> (see also: <strong><strong>Android</strong></strong>'s Missing Leg ). <strong>Cloud Street</strong> <strong>meets</strong> Main Street 

 Now, <strong>consider</strong> <strong><strong>Amazon</strong></strong>, the <strong>ecommerce company</strong> that many have officially anointed as this <strong>generation</strong>'s <strong><strong>Walmart</strong> (</strong>see <strong>chart</strong> below: <strong>Walmart</strong>, <strong><strong>Amazon</strong></strong>, <strong>Google</strong> and <strong>Apple head-to-head</strong> over the past 10 years). A <strong>comparison</strong> of <strong>Walmart</strong>, <strong>Amazon</strong>, <strong>Google</strong> and <strong>Apple</strong> from <strong>October</strong>, 2001 to August, 2011. <strong>See</strong> a larger <strong>version</strong> and read related analysis . <strong>Amazon</strong>, in <strong>fact</strong>, just experienced its <strong>fastest revenue growth quarter</strong> in over a <strong>decade</strong> (up 51<strong>% versus</strong> the same period in 2010). It is unquestionably on a roll. To establish the <strong>scale</strong> and <strong>market presence</strong> that <strong>Amazon</strong> has on "Cloud Street" in about <strong>one-third</strong> of the <strong>time</strong> it took for <strong>Walmart</strong> to dominate "Main Street" is nothing short of amazing. Simply put, it's emblematic of a <strong>company</strong> whose <strong>ability</strong> to marry a clear, disciplined <strong>strategy</strong> with a pragmatic <strong>focus</strong> on tactical <strong>execution</strong> knows few bounds. <strong><strong>Kindle</strong></strong> as an <strong>entry point</strong> for a new <strong>tablet design</strong> 

 <strong>Amazon</strong>'s <strong><strong>Kindle</strong></strong> <strong>reading device</strong> has catapulted the <strong>company</strong> into a <strong>position</strong> where it's now selling more digital <strong><strong>books</strong></strong> than <strong>print</strong> <strong><strong>books</strong></strong>, all at a <strong>time</strong> when the physical <strong><strong>books</strong></strong>tore is on its last <strong>legs</strong> (<strong>Borders</strong> is gone, <strong>Barnes</strong> & <strong>Noble</strong> is for sale). Now, having proven that it can execute a hardware-software-service <strong>play vis-</strong>à<strong>-vis</strong> the <strong>Kindle</strong>, <strong>Amazon</strong> is expected to <strong>announce</strong> its first <strong>iPad</strong> <strong>competitor</strong> in a <strong>matter</strong> of days . Such a <strong>device</strong> will build upon several "unfair <strong>advantages</strong>" that <strong>Amazon</strong> has established in the <strong><strong>marketplace</strong></strong>: 

 
	 <strong>Ecommerce</strong> and <strong><strong>marketplace</strong></strong> logistics. <strong>Digital</strong> <strong>media</strong> <strong>content acquisition</strong>, <strong>publishing</strong> and distribution. <strong>Cloud</strong> <strong>computing platform know-how</strong> and a nascent ecosystem. Just as <strong>Apple</strong> has leveraged its <strong>iTunes</strong> as the <strong>wedge</strong> upon which it established a <strong>billing relationship</strong> with 160 million <strong>users</strong> , <strong>Amazon</strong> has built a differentiated <strong>position</strong> of its own called <strong>Amazon</strong> Prime . <strong>Amazon</strong>'s "Prime Directive" 

 Returning to the <strong>start</strong> of the <strong>article</strong>, <strong>remember</strong> the <strong>success mantra</strong> that I told you about for my company? You can apply the same <strong>logic</strong> when looking at how <strong>Amazon</strong> matches up to Apple. <strong>Apple</strong>'s initial <strong>innovation</strong> with <strong>iTunes</strong> was that it afforded <strong>consumers</strong> the <strong>ability</strong> to purchase music <strong>à la carte</strong> — one single at a <strong>time</strong> — when up until that <strong>point</strong> it could only be purchased in <strong>record</strong> or <strong>CD</strong> form. <strong>Coupled</strong> with a $0.99 per song <strong>pricing model</strong> and the unparalleled <strong>convenience</strong> of click-buy-play, this was a <strong>recipe</strong> to change the <strong>way</strong> that <strong>customers</strong> bought and experienced music. Similarly, <strong>Amazon</strong>'s initial <strong>innovation</strong> with <strong>Amazon</strong>.com was that it enabled <strong>people</strong> to discover, <strong>purchase</strong> and transparently receive a seemingly <strong>bottomless</strong> wellspring of <strong>books</strong>, where formerly you pretty much only got what was on the <strong>shelves</strong> in the <strong>books</strong>tore. Like <strong>Apple</strong>, <strong>Amazon</strong> used a disruptive <strong>pricing</strong> and <strong>logistics</strong> model to <strong>entice</strong> <strong>customers</strong> to change their buying behavior. That <strong>Apple</strong> has expanded <strong>iTunes</strong> into an <strong>App Store (</strong>and iBooks<strong>)</strong> and a <strong>family</strong> of <strong>devices</strong> bound by a common <strong>software platform</strong>, and <strong>Amazon</strong> has expanded its <strong>catalog</strong> to <strong>products</strong> and <strong>services</strong> of all <strong>stripes</strong> (<strong>analog</strong> and digital<strong>)</strong>, makes <strong>perfect sense</strong> in this context. From the initial "design win" of music <strong>buying</strong> and <strong>book</strong> <strong>buying</strong>, both <strong>companies</strong> have grown the <strong>categories</strong> and aggregate <strong>dollars</strong> of their <strong>bases</strong> in <strong>ways</strong> that have made <strong>consumers</strong> want to be more deeply embedded in their <strong>relationships</strong> with <strong>Apple</strong> and Amazon. The <strong>Amazon Prime</strong> <strong>product</strong> has cultivated a <strong>base</strong> of an estimated five million <strong>subscribers</strong> (from the <strong>company</strong>'s aggregate <strong>base</strong> of 120 million <strong>customers</strong> ) that, in <strong>exchange</strong> for an annual $79 <strong>fee</strong>, provides expedited shipping on many <strong>product</strong>s. Why is this a big deal? The friction-free <strong>model</strong> is enticing some <strong>customers</strong> to use <strong>Amazon</strong> for <strong>product</strong> <strong>purchases</strong> (<strong>e.g.</strong>, <strong>bulk</strong> <strong>goods</strong>, <strong>toiletries</strong>) that historically have been the <strong>parlance</strong> of the local <strong>Walgreens</strong> or Costco. So, if <strong>MG Siegler</strong> of <strong>TechCrunch</strong> is correct in his <strong>excellent scoop</strong> on <strong><strong>Amazon</strong></strong>'s <strong>Kindle Tablet</strong>, then <strong><strong>Amazon</strong></strong> will be bundling <strong><strong>Amazon</strong></strong> Prime with its forthcoming 7-inch <strong>tablet <strong>device</strong></strong> and <strong>pricing</strong> the <strong>device</strong> at a disruptively low <strong>price point</strong> of $250 — about half the <strong>cost</strong> of an entry-level iPad. If you create a <strong>superset</strong> between <strong>Kindle</strong> <strong>buyers</strong> and <strong>Prime</strong> <strong>subscribers</strong>, a logical <strong>early-adopter user base</strong> <strong>emerges</strong> for <strong>Amazon</strong> to target for its <strong>iPad</strong> <strong>alternative</strong> (in <strong>terms</strong> of <strong>price</strong>, footprint and aggregate value proposition). <strong>Plus</strong>, from a strategic <strong>leverage perspective</strong>, it makes total sense. Amazon, after all, is first and foremost a great retailer. <strong>Add</strong> on to this <strong>value proposition</strong> the <strong>fact</strong> that <strong>Amazon</strong> has surrounded its <strong>Prime</strong> <strong>offering</strong> with an ever-growing free <strong>library</strong> of bundled <strong>video content</strong> (<strong>i.e.</strong>, a poor <strong>man</strong>'s <strong>Netflix</strong> <strong>streaming service</strong>), and the <strong>Kindle Tablet</strong> starts to feel like a <strong>lifestyle device</strong> that can succeed over the long haul. After all, <strong>media</strong> is a big <strong>differentiator</strong> on this <strong>type</strong> of device. And in <strong>terms</strong> of <strong>sheer</strong> <strong>economics</strong>, there are a <strong>lot</strong> of <strong>people</strong> these <strong>days</strong> for whom a bundled <strong>video service</strong> with a pay-as-you-go <strong>library</strong> of <strong>premium music</strong>, <strong>books</strong>, video and app offerings feels right at $250. No less, if we know <strong>anything</strong> about <strong>Amazon</strong>, it is that it, like <strong>Apple</strong>, has the <strong>fortitude</strong>, focus and <strong>sense</strong> of <strong>purpose</strong> to see big <strong>ideas</strong> through to long-term success. <strong>Amazon</strong>, after all, wants to be the only <strong>shopping cart</strong> you'll ever need, and this becomes another <strong>channel</strong> back to the consumer. <strong>Plus</strong>, from an average <strong>revenue</strong> per <strong>user perspective</strong> (<strong>ARPU</strong>), you can probably subsidize the <strong>device</strong> a <strong>bit</strong> more with the <strong><strong>Prime</strong></strong> <strong>subscriber</strong>, knowing that <strong><strong>Prime</strong></strong> <strong>customers</strong> are already paying $79 a <strong>year</strong> and are faithful, dedicated, <strong>recurrent commerce</strong> <strong>customers</strong>. Some final <strong>thoughts</strong>: 

 Just because <strong>Amazon</strong> has a logical <strong>path</strong> to <strong>finding</strong> a "wedge" in the tablet computing market doesn't mean that it will. There are hard strategic <strong>decisions</strong> about how to fork <strong>Android</strong> and how that <strong>ties</strong> in with <strong>Amazon</strong>'s <strong>Appstore</strong> <strong>strategy</strong> , including <strong>approaches</strong> to competing <strong>services</strong> (<strong>e.g.</strong>, will <strong>Amazon</strong> allow <strong>Nook</strong> or iBooks to be installed?). Moreover, is <strong>Amazon</strong> prepared to develop and <strong>support</strong> a <strong>software <strong>developer</strong></strong>'s <strong>kit</strong> (<strong>SDK</strong>) and get sucked into a <strong>developer</strong> <strong>tools arms</strong> race with Apple? Similarly, how does <strong><strong>Amazon</strong> Web</strong> <strong>Services</strong> and <strong>Amazon</strong>'s <strong>cloud platform fold</strong> into the equation? Like I said at the <strong>start</strong>, mobile <strong>platforms</strong> are really hard to create and execute, but if <strong>anyone</strong> is in a <strong>position</strong> to do just that, it's Amazon. <strong>Android Open</strong> , being held <strong>October</strong> 9-11 in <strong>San Francisco</strong>, is a big-tent <strong>meeting ground</strong> for <strong>app</strong> and <strong>game</strong> <strong>developers</strong>, <strong>carriers</strong>, <strong>chip</strong> <strong>manufacturers</strong>, <strong>content</strong> <strong>creators</strong>, <strong>OEMs</strong>, <strong>researchers</strong>, <strong>entrepreneurs</strong>, <strong>VCs</strong>, and <strong>business</strong> leaders. <strong>Save</strong> 20<strong>%</strong> on <strong>registration</strong> with the <strong>code</strong> AN11RAD
