    <body><strong>BERG London Week</strong> 328 -- we're a <strong>design company</strong>, with a <strong>design culture built</strong> over 6 <strong>years</strong>, yet we're having to cultivate a new <strong>engineering culture</strong> that sits within it and alongside it, and the two have different crystal grains. It's good that they do—<strong>engineering</strong> through a <strong>design process</strong> can feel harried and for some <strong>projects</strong> that does not lead to good outcomes. And vice versa. But it throws up all <strong>kinds</strong> of <strong>questions</strong> for me: do we really want two <strong>domains</strong> of <strong>engineering</strong> and <strong>design</strong>; what is the common <strong>protocol</strong>—the common <strong>language</strong>—of <strong>engineering</strong> culture, and indeed of our <strong>design</strong> culture; how do these <strong>lattices</strong> touch and <strong>interact</strong> where they meet; how do we go from an <strong>unthought process</strong> to one <strong>chosen</strong> deliberately; how is <strong>change</strong> (the <strong>group understanding</strong> of, and <strong>agreement</strong> with a common <strong>language</strong>) to be brought about, and what will it feel like as it happens. I think more and more <strong>businesses</strong> will have to explicitly confront the <strong>challenge</strong> of reconciling <strong>design</strong> with <strong>engineering</strong>, <strong>novelty</strong> with <strong>constancy</strong>, <strong>innovation</strong> with repetition. <strong>Science</strong> is doing <strong>something</strong> once in a <strong>way</strong> that others might able to reproduce, however long it takes. <strong>Business</strong> is doing it the same <strong>way</strong> a million times, as fast as possible. Why We <strong>Love The Things We Build</strong> -- psychological <strong>research</strong> to look at <strong>people</strong> valuing the things they build. <strong>Lots</strong> of interesting <strong>findings</strong>: <strong>participants</strong> thought <strong><strong>others</strong></strong> would <strong>value</strong> their <strong>origami</strong> <strong><strong>creations</strong></strong> highly, despite <strong>assigning</strong> little <strong>value</strong> to the <strong>amateur</strong> <strong><strong>creations</strong></strong> of <strong><strong>others</strong></strong> and incomplete <strong>items</strong> were not <strong>value</strong>d as highly as completed <strong>items</strong> . <strong>(</strong>via BoingBoing ) 
 Gut Flora Social Network <strong>(</strong>New Scientist) -- although there's real <strong>science</strong> behind it, I think it's mostly a callous <strong>play</strong> to get <strong>web</strong> <strong>journalists</strong> to say "this social <strong>network</strong> is a bit shit". <strong>(</strong>via Dave Moskowitz ) 
 The Unintended Consequences of Cyber<strong><strong>bullying</strong></strong> Rhetoric <strong>(</strong><strong>danah</strong> boyd) -- actual <strong>research</strong> on <strong><strong>bullying</strong></strong> and cyber<strong><strong>bullying</strong></strong>, indicating that those involved in cyber<strong><strong>bullying</strong></strong> don't think of what they're involved in as <strong><strong>bullying</strong></strong>, because that implies <strong>power</strong> relationships they don't want to acknowledge. Instead it's all <strong>part</strong> of the <strong>"</strong>drama<strong>"</strong> of high-school.</body>
