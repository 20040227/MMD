       " '\\n',\n",
       " '\\tThe villagers of Little Hangleron still called it \"the Riddle House,\" even though it had been many years since the Riddle family had lived there.  It stood on a hill overlooking the village, some of its windows boarded, tiles missing from its roof, and ivy spreading unchecked over its face.  Once a fine-looking manor, and easily the largest and grandest building for miles around, the Riddle House was now damp, derelict, and unoccupied.\\n',\n",
       " '\\tThe Little Hagletons all agreed that the old house was \"creepy.\"  Half a century ago, something strange and horrible had happened there, something that the older inhabitants of the village still liked to discuss when topics for gossip were scarce.  The story had been picked over so many times, and had been embroidered in so many places, that nobody was quite sure what the truth was anymore.  Every version of the tale, however, started in the same place:  Fifty years before, at daybreak on a fine summer\\'s morning when the Riddle House had still been well kept and impressive, a maid had entered the drawing room to find all three Riddles dead.  \\n',\n",
       " '\\tThe maid had run screaming down the hill into the village and roused as many people as she could.\\n',\n",
       " '\\t\"Lying there with their eyes wide open!  Cold as ice!  Still in their dinner things!\"\\n',\n",
       " '\\tThe police were summoned, and the whole of Little Hangleton had seethed with shocked curiosity and ill-disguised excitement.  Nobody wasted their breath pretending to feel very sad about the Riddles, for they had been most unpopular.  Elderly Mr. and Mrs. Riddle had been rich, snobbish, and rude, and their grown-up son, Tom, had been, if anything, worse.  All the villagers cared about was the identity of their murderer -- for plainly, three apparently healthy people did not all drop dead of natural causes on the same night.\\n',\n",
       " \"\\tThe Hanged Man, the village pub, did a roaring trade that night; the whole village seemed to have turned out to discuss the murders.  They were rewarded for leaving their firesides when the Riddles' cook arrived dramatically in their midst and announced to the suddenly silent pub that a man called Frank Bryce had just  been arrested.\\n\",\n",
       " '\\t\"Frank!\" cried several people.  \"Never!\"\\n',\n",
       " \"\\tFrank Bryce was the Riddles' gardener.  He lived alone in a run-down cottage on the grounds of the Riddle House.  Frank had come back from the war with a very stiff leg and a great dislike of crowds and loud noises, and had been working for the Riddles ever since.\\n\",\n",
       " '\\tThere was a rush to buy the cook drinks and hear more details.\\n',\n",
       " '\\t\"Always thought he was odd,\" she told the eagerly listening villagers, after her fourth sherry.  \"Unfriendly, like.  I\\'m sure if I\\'ve offered him a cuppa once, I\\'ve offered it a hundred times.  Never wanted to mix, he didn\\'t.\"\\n',\n",
       " '\\t\"Ah, now,\" said a woman at the bar, \"he had a hard war, Frank.  He likes the quiet life.  That\\'s no reason to --\"\\n',\n",
       " '\\t\"Who else had a key to the back door, then?\" barked the cook.  \"There\\'s been a spare key hanging in the gardener\\'s cottage far back as I can remember!  Nobody forced the door last night!  No broken windows!  All Frank had to do was creep up to the big house while we was all sleeping...\"\\n',\n",
       " '\\tThe villagers exchanged dark looks.\\n',\n",
       " '\\t\"I always thought that he had a nasty look about him, right enough,\" grunted a man at the bar.\\n',\n",
       " '\\t\"War turned him funny, if you ask me,\" said the landlord.\\n',\n",
       " '\\t\"Told you I wouldn\\'t like to get on the wrong side of Frank, didn\\'t I, Dot?\" said an excited woman in the corner.\\n',\n",
       " '\\t\"Horrible temper,\" said Dot, nodding fervently.  \"I remember, when he was a kid...\"\\n',\n",
       " '\\tBy the following morning, hardly anyone in Little Hangleton doubted that Frank Bryce had killed the Riddles.\\n',\n",
       " \"\\tBut over in the neighboring town of Great Hangleton, in the dark and dingy police station, Frank was stubbornly repeating, again and again, that he was innocent, and that the only person he had seen near the house on the day of the Riddles' deaths had been a teenage boy, a stranger, dark-haired and pale.  Nobody else in the village had seen any such boy, and the police were quite sure Frank had invented him.\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\tThen, just when things were looking very serious for Frank, the report on the Riddles' bodies came back and changed everything.\\n\",\n",
       " '\\tThe police had never read an odder report.  A team of doctors had examined the bodies and had concluded that none of the Riddles had been poisoned, stabbed, shot, strangles, suffocated, or (as far as they could tell) harmed at all.  In fact (the report continued, in a tone of unmistakable bewilderment), the Riddles all appeared to be in perfet health -- apart from the fact that they were all dead.  The doctors did note (as though determined to find something wrong with the bodies) that each of the Riddles had a look of terror upon his or her face -- but as the frustrated police said, whoever heard of three people being frightened to death?\\n',\n",
       " \"\\tAs there was no proof that the Riddles had been murdered at all, the police were forced to let Frank go.  The Riddles were buried in the Little Hangleton churchyard, and their graves remained objects of curiosity for a while.  To everyone's surprise, and amid a cloud of suspicion, Frank Bryce returned to his cottage on the grounds of the Riddle House.\\n\",\n",
       " '\\t\"\\'S far as I\\'m concerned, he killed them, and I don\\'t care what the police say,\" said Dot in the Hanged Man.  \"And if he had any decency, he\\'d leave here, knowing as how we knows he did it.\"\\n',\n",
       " '\\tBut Frank did not leave.  He stayed to tend the garden for the next family who lived in the Riddle House, and then the next -- for neither family stayed long.  Perhaps it was partly because of Frank that the new owners said there was a nasty feeling about the place, which, in the absence of inhabitants, started to fall into disrepair.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " '\\tThe wealthy man who owned the Riddle House these days neither lived there nor put it to any use; they said in the village that he kept it for \"tax reasons,\" though nobody was very clear what these might be.  The wealthy owner continued to pay Frank to do the gardening, however.  Frank was nearing his seventy-seventh birthday now, very deaf, his bad leg stiffer than ever, but could be seen pottering around the flower beds in fine weather, even though the weeds were starting to creep up on him, try as he might to suppress them.\\n',\n",
       " \"\\tWeeds were not the only things Frank had to contend with either.  Boys from the village made a habit of throwing stones through the windows of the Riddle House.  They rode their bicycles over the lawns Frank worked so hard to keep smooth.  Once or twice, they broke into the old house for a dare.  They knew that old Frank's devotion to the house and the grounds amounted almost to an obsession, and it amused them to see him limping across the garden, brandishing his stick and yelling croakily at them.  Frank, for his part, believed the boys tormented him because they, like their parents and grandparents, though him a murderer.  So when Frank awoke one night in August and saw something very odd up at the old house, he merely assumed that the boys had gone one step further in their attempts to punish him.\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\tIt was Frank's bad leg that woke him; it was paining him worse than ever in his old age.  He got up and limped downstairs into the kitchen with the idea of refilling his hot-water bottle to ease the stiffness in his knee.  Standing at the sink, filling the kettle, he looked up at the Riddle House and saw lights glimmering in its upper windows.  Frank knew at once what was going on.  The boys had broken into the house again, and judging by the flickering quality of the light, they had started a fire.\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\tFrank had no telephone, in any case, he had deeply mistrusted the police ever since they had taken him in for questioning about the Riddles' deaths.  He put down the kettle at once, hurried back upstairs as fast as his bad leg would allow, and was soon back in his kitchen, fully dressed and removing a rusty old key from its hook by the door.  He picked up his walking stick, which was propped against the wall, and set off into the night.  \\n\",\n",
       " '\\tThe front door of the Riddle House bore no sign of being forced, nor did any of the windows.  Frank limped around to the back of the house until he reached a door almost completely hidden by ivy, took out the old key, put it into the lock, and opened the door noiselessly.\\n',\n",
       " '\\tHe let himself into the cavernous kitchen.  Frank had not entered it for many years; nevertheless, although it was very dark, he remembered where the door into the hall was, and he groped his way towards it, his nostrils full of the smell of decay, ears pricked for any sound of footsteps or voices from overhead.  He reached the hall, which was a little lighter owing to the large mullioned windows on either side of the front door, and started to climb the stairs, blessing the dust that lay thick upon the stone, because it muffled the sound of his feet and stick.\\n',\n",
       " '\\tOn the landing, Frank turned right, and saw at once where the intruders were:  At the every end of the passage a door stood ajar, and a flickering light shone through the gap, casting a long sliver of gold across the black floor.  Frank edged closer and closer, he was able to see a narrow slice of the room beyond.\\n',\n",
       " \"\\tThe fire, he now saw, had been lit in the grate.  This surprised him.  Then he stopped moving and listened intently, for a man's voice spoke within the room; it sounded timid and fearful.\\n\",\n",
       " '\\t\"There is a little more in the bottle, My Lord, if you are still hungry.\"\\n',\n",
       " '\\t\"Later,\" said a second voice.  This too belonged to a man -- but it was strangely high-pitched, and cold as a sudden blast of icy wind.  Something about that voice made the sparse hairs on the back of Frank\\'s neck stand up.  \"Move me closer to the fire, Wormtail.\"\\n',\n",
       " '\\tFrank turned his right ear toward the door, the better to hear.  There came the clink of a bottle being put down upon some hard surface, and then the dull scraping noise of a heavy chair being dragged across the floor.  Frank caught a glimpse of a small man, his back to the door, pushing the chair into place.  He was wearing a long black cloak, and there was a bald patch at the back of his head.  Then he went out of sight again.\\n',\n",
       " '\\t\"Where is Nagini?\" said the cold voice.\\n',\n",
       " '\\t\"I -- I don\\'t know, My Lord,\" said the first voice nervously.  \"She set out to explore the house, I think...\"\\n',\n",
       " '\\t\"You will milk her before we retire, Wormtail,\" said the second voice.  \"I will need feeding in the night.  The journey has tired me greatly.\"\\n',\n",
       " '\\tBrow furrowed, Frank inclined his good ear still closer to the door, listening very hard.  There was a pause, and then the man called Wormtail spoke again.\\n',\n",
       " '\\t\"My Lord, may I ask how long we are going to stay here?\"\\n',\n",
       " '\\t\"A week,\" said the cold voice.  \"Perhapse longer.  The place is moderately comfortable, and the plan cannot proceed yet.  It would be foolish to act before the Quidditch World Cup is over.\"\\n',\n",
       " '\\tFrank inserted a gnarled finger into his ear and rotated it.  Owing, no doubt, to a buildup of earwax, he had heard the word \"Quidditch,\" which was not a word at all.\\n',\n",
       " '\\t\"The -- the Quidditch World Cup, My Lord?\" said Wormtail.  (Frank dug his finger still more vigorously into his ear.)  \"Forgive me, but -- I do not understand -- why should we wait until the World Cup is over?\"\\n',\n",
       " '\\t\"Because, fool, at this very moment wizards are pouring into the country from all over the world, and every meddler from the Ministry of Magic will be on duty, on the watch for signs of ususual activity, checking and double-checking identities.  They will be obsessed with security, lest the Muggles notice anything.  So we wait.\"\\n',\n",
       " '\\tFrank stopped trying to clear out his ear.  He had distinctly heard the words \"Ministry of Magic,\" \"wizards,\" and \"Muggles.\"  Plainly, each of these expressions meant something secret, and Frank could think of only two sorts of people who would speak in code:  spies and criminals.  Frank tightened his hold on his walking stick once more, and listened more closely still.\\n',\n",
       " '\\t\"Your Lordship is still determined, then?\"  Wormtail said quietly.\\n',\n",
       " '\\t\"Certainly I am determined, Wormtail.\"  There was a note of menace in the cold voice now.\\n',\n",
       " '\\tA slight pause followed -- and the Wormtail spoke, the words tumbling from him in a rush, as though he was forcing himself to say this before he lost his nerve.\\n',\n",
       " '\\t\"It could be done without Harry Potter, My Lord.\"\\n',\n",
       " '\\tAnother pause, more protracted, and then --\\n',\n",
       " '\\t\"Without Harry Potter?\" breathed the second voice softly.  \"I see...\"\\n',\n",
       " '\\t\"My Lord, I do not say this out of concern for the boy!\"  said Wormtail, his voice rising squeakily.  \"The boy is nothing to me, nothing at all!  It is merely that if we were to use another witch or wizard -- any wizard -- the thing could be done so much more quickly!  If you allowed me to leave you for a short while -- you know that I can disguise myself most effectively -- I could be back here in as little as two days with a suitable person --\"\\n',\n",
       " '\\t\"I could use another wizard,\" said the cold voice softly, \"that is true...\"\\n',\n",
       " '\\t\"My Lord, it makes sense,\" said Wormtail, sounding thoroughly relieved now.  \"Laying hands on Harry Potter would be so difficult, he is so well protected --\"\\n',\n",
       " '\\t\"And so you volunteer to go and fetch me a substitute?  I wonder...perhaps the task of nursing me has become wearisome for you, Wormtail?  Could this suggestion of abandoning the plan be nothing more than an attempt to desert me?\"\\n',\n",
       " '\\t\"My Lord!  I -- I have no wish to leave you, none at all --\"\\n',\n",
       " '\\t\"Do not lie to me!\"  hissed the second voice.  \"I can always tell, Wormtail!  You are regretting that you ever returned to me.  I revolt you.  I see you flinch when you look at me, feel you shudder when you touch me...\"\\n',\n",
       " '\\t\"No!  My devotion to Your Lordship --\"\\n',\n",
       " '\\t\"Your devotion is nothing more than cowardice.  You would not be here if you had anywhere else to go.  How am I to survive without you, when I need feeding every few hours?  Who is to milk Nagini?\"\\n',\n",
       " '\\t\"But you seem so much stronger, My Lord --\"\\n',\n",
       " '\\t\"Liar,\" breathed the second voice.  \"I am no stronger, and a few days alone would be enough to rob me of the little health I have regained under your clumsy care.  Silence!\"\\n',\n",
       " '\\tWormtail, who had been sputtering incoherently, fell silent at once.  For a few seconds, Frank could hear nothing but the fire crackling.  The the second man spoke once more, in a whisper that was almost a hiss.\\n',\n",
       " '\\t\"I have my reasons for using the boy, as I have already explained to you, and I will use no other.  I have waited thirteen years.  A few more months will make no difference.  As for the protection surrounding the boy, I believe my plan will be effective.  All that is needed is a little courage from you, Wormtail -- courage you will find, unless you wish to feel the full extent of Lord Voldermort\\'s wrath --\"\\n',\n",
       " '\\t\"My Lord, I must speak!\"  said Wormtail, panic in his voice now.  \"All through our journey I have gone over the plan in my head -- My Lord, Bertha Jorkin\\'s disappearance will not go unnoticed for long, and if we proceed, if I murder --\"\\n',\n",
       " '\\t\"If?\"  whispered the second voice.  \"If?  If you follow the plan, Wormtail, the Ministry need never know that anyone else has died.  You will do it quietly and without fuss; I only wish that i could do it myself, but in my present condition...Come, Wormtail, one more death and our path to Harry Potter is clear.  I am not asking you to do it alone.  By that time, my faithful serant will have rejoined us --\"\\n',\n",
       " '\\t\"I am a faithful servant,\"  said Wormtail, the merest trace of sullenness in his voice.\\n',\n",
       " '\\t\"Wormtail, I need somebody with brains, somebody whose loyalty has never wavered, and you, unfortunately, fulfill neither requirement.\"\\n',\n",
       " '\\t\"I found you,\" said Wormtail, and there was definitely a sulky edge to his voice now.  \"I was the one who found you.  I brought you Bertha Jorkins.\"\\n',\n",
       " '\\t\"That is true,\" said the second man, sounding amused.  \"A stroke of brilliance I would not have thought possible from you, Wormtail -- though, if truth be told, you were not aware how useful she would be when you caught her, were you?\"\\n',\n",
       " '\\t\"I -- I thought she might be useful, My Lord --\"\\n',\n",
       " '\\t\"Liar,\" said the second voice again, the cruel amusement more pronounced than ever.  \"However, I do not deny that her information was invaluable.  Without it, I could never have formed our plan, and for that, you will have your reward, Wormtail.  I will allow you to perform an essential task for me, one that many of my followers would give their right hands to perform...\"\\n',\n",
       " '\\t\"R-really, My Lord?  What -- ?\"  Wormtail sounded terrified again.\\n',\n",
       " '\\t\"Ah, Wormtail, you don\\'t want me to spoil the surprise?  Your part will come at the very end...but I promise you, you will have the honor of being just as useful as Bertha Jorkins.\"\\n',\n",
       " '\\t\"You...you...\"  Wormtail\\'s voice suddenly sounded hoarse, as though his mouth had gone very dry.  \"You...are going...to kill me too?\"\\n',\n",
       " '\\t\"Wormtail, Wormtail,\" said the cold voice silkily, \"why would I kill you?  I killed Bertha because I had to.  She was fit for nothing after my questioning, quite useless.  In any case, awkward questions would have been asked if she had gone back to the Ministry with the news that she had met you on her holidays.  Wizards who are supposed to be dead would do well not to run into Ministry of Magic witches at wayside inns...\"\\n',\n",
       " '\\tWormtail muttered something so quietly that Frank could not hear it, but it made the second man laugh -- an entirely mirthless laugh, cold as his speech.\\n',\n",
       " '\\t\"We could have modified her memory?  But Memory Charms can be broken by a powerful wizard, as I proved when I questioned her.  It would be an insult to her memory not to use the information I extracted from her, Wormtail.\"\\n',\n",
       " '\\tOut in the corridor, Frank suddenly became aware that the hand gripping his walking stick was slippery with sweat.  The man with the cold voice had killed a woman.  He was talking about it without any kind of remorse -- with amusement.  He was dangerous -- a madman.  And he was planning more murders -- this boy, Harry Potter, whoever he was -- was in danger --\\n',\n",
       " '\\tFrank knew what he must do.  Now, if ever, was the time to go to the police.  He would creep out of the house and head straight for the telephone box in the village...but the cold voice was speaking again, and Frank remained where he was, frozen to the spot, listening with all his might.\\n',\n",
       " '\\t\"One more murder...my faithful servant at Hogwarts...Harry Potter is as good as mine, Wormtail.  It is decided.  There will be no more argument.  But quiet...I think I hear Nagini...\"\\n',\n",
       " \"\\tAnd the second man's voice changed.  He started making noises such as Frank had never heard before; he was hissing and spitting without drawing breath.  Frank thought he must be having some sort of fit or seizure.\\n\",\n",
       " '\\tAnd then Frank heard movement behind him in the dark passageway.  He turned to look, and found himself paralyzed with fright.\\n',\n",
       " '\\tSomething was slithering toward him along the dark corridor floor, and as it drew nearer to the sliver of firelight, he realized with a thrill of terror that it was a gigantic snake, at least twelve feet long.  Horrified, transfixed, Frank stared as its undulating body cut a wide, curving track through the thick dust on the floor, coming closer and closer -- What was he to do?  The only means of escape was into the room where the two men sat plotting murder, yet if he stayed where he was the snake would surely kill him --\\n',\n",
       " '\\tBut before he had made his decision, the snake was level with him, and then, incredibly, miraculously, it was passing; it was following the spitting, hissing noises made by the cold voice beyond the door, and in seconds, the tip of its diamond-patterned tail had vanished through the gap.\\n',\n",
       " \"\\tThere was sweat on Frank's forehead now, and the hand on the walking stick was trembling.  Inside the room, the cold voice was continuing to hiss, and Frank was visited by a strange idea, an impossible idea...This man could talk to snakes.\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\tFrank didn't understand what was going on.  He wanted more than anything to be back in his bed with his hot-water bottle.  The problem was that his legs didn't seem to want to move.  As he stood there shaking and trying to master himself, the cold voice switched abruptly to English again.\\n\",\n",
       " '\\t\"Nagini has interesting news, Wormtail,\" it said.\\n',\n",
       " '\\t\"In-indeed, My Lord?\"  said Wormtail.\\n',\n",
       " '\\t\"Indeed, yes,\" said the voice, \"According to Nagini, there is an old Muggle standing right outside this room, listening to every word we say.\"\\n',\n",
       " \"\\tFrank didn't have a chance to hide himself.  There were footsteps and then the door of the room was flung wide open.\\n\",\n",
       " '\\tA short, balding man with graying hair, a pointed nose, and small, watery eyes stood before Frank, a mixture of fear and alarm in his face.\\n',\n",
       " '\\t\"Invite him inside, Wormtail.  Where are your manners?\"\\n',\n",
       " \"\\tThe cold voice was coming from the ancient armchair before the fire, but Frank couldn't see the speaker.  the snake, on the other hand, was curled up on the rotting hearth rug, like some horrible travesty of a pet dog.\\n\",\n",
       " '\\tWormtail beckoned Frank into the room.  Though still deeply shaken, Frank took a firmer grip on his walking stick and limped over the threshold.\\n',\n",
       " \"\\tThe fire was the only source of light in the room; it cast long, spidery shadows upon the walls.  Frank stared at the back of the armchair; the man inside it seemed to be even smaller than his servant, for Frank couldn't even see the back of his head.\\n\",\n",
       " '\\t\"You heard everything, Muggle?\"  said the cold voice.\\n',\n",
       " '\\t\"What\\'s that you\\'re calling me?\"  said Frank defiantly, for now that he was inside the room, now that the time had come for some sort of action, he felt braver; it had always been so in the war.\\n',\n",
       " '\\t\"I am calling you a Muggle,\" said the voice coolly.  \"It means that you are not a wizard.\"\\n',\n",
       " '\\t\"I don\\'t know what you mean by wizard,\" said Frank, his voice growing steadier.  \"All I know is I\\'ve heard enough to interest the police tonight, I have.  You\\'ve done murder and you\\'re planning more!  And I\\'ll tell youthis too,\" he added, on a sudden inspiration, \"my wife knows I\\'m up here, and if I don\\'t come back --\"\\n',\n",
       " '\\t\"You have no wife,\" said te cold voice, very quietly.  \"Nobody knows you are here.  You told nobody that you were coming.  Do not lie to Lord Voldemort, Muggle, for he knows...he always knows...\"\\n',\n",
       " '\\t\"Is that right?\"  said Frank roughly.  \"Lord, is it?  Well, I don\\'t think much of your manners, My Lord.  Turn \\'round and face me like a man, why don\\'t you?\"\\n',\n",
       " '\\t\"But I am not a man, Muggle,\" said the cold voice, barely audible now over the crackling of the flames.  \"I am much, much more than a man.  However...why not?  I will face you...Wormtail, come turn my chair around.\"\\n',\n",
       " '\\tThe servant gave a whimper.\\n',\n",
       " '\\t\"You heard me, Wormtail.\"\\n',\n",
       " '\\tSlowly, with his face screwed up, as though he would rather have done anything than approach his master and the hearth rug where the snake lay, the small man walked forward and began to turn the chair.  The snake lifted its ugly triangular head and hissed slightly as the legs of the chair snagged on its rug.\\n',\n",
       " '\\tAnd then the chair was facing Frank, and he saw what was sitting in it.  His walking stick fell to the floor with a clatter.  He opened his mouth and let out a scream.  He was screaming so loudly that he never heard the words the thing in the chair spoke as it raised a wand.  There was a flash of green light, a rushing sound, and Frank Bryce crumpled.  He was dead before he hit the floor.\\n',\n",
       " '\\tTwo hundred miles away, the boy called Harry Potter woke with a start.\\n',\n",

       " 'CHAPTER TWO - THE SCAR\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " '\\tHarry lay flat on his back, breathing hard as though he had been running.  He had awoken from a vivid dream with his hands pressed over his face.  The old scar on his forehead, which was shaped like a bolt of lightning, was burning beneath his fingers as though someone had just pressed a white-hot wire to his skin.\\n',\n",
       " '\\tHe sat up, one hand still on his scar, the other hand reaching out in the darkness for his glasses, which were on the bedside table.  He put them on and his bedroom came into clearer focus, lit by a faint, misty orange light that was filtering through the curtains from the street lamp outside the window.\\n',\n",
       " '\\tHarry ran his fingers over the scar again.  It was still painful.  He turned on the lamp beside him, scrambled out of bed, crossed the room, opened his wardrobe, and peered into the mirror on the inside of the door.  A skinny boy of fourteen looked back at him, his bright green eyes puzzled under his untidy black hair.  He examined the lightning-bolt scar of his reflection more closely.  It looked normal, but it was still stinging.\\n',\n",
       " \"\\tharry tried to recall what he had been dreaming about before he had awoken.  It had seemed so real...There had been two people he knew and one he didn't ...He concentrated hard, frowning, trying to remember...\\n\",\n",
       " '\\tThe dim picture of a darkened room came to him...There had been a snake on a hearth rug...a small man called Peter, nicknamed Wormtail...and a cold, high voice...the voice of Lord Voldemort.  Harry felt as though an ice cube had slipped down into his stomach at the very thought...\\n',\n",
       " \"\\tHe closed his eyes tightly and tried to remember what Voldemort had looked like, but it was impossible...All Harry knew was that at the moment when Voldemort's chair had swung around, and he, Harry, had seen what was sitting in it, he had felt a spasm of horror, which had awoken him...or had that been the pain in his scar?\\n\",\n",
       " '\\tAnd who had the old man been?  For there had definitely been an old man; Harry had watched him fall to the ground.  It was all becoming confused.  Harry put his face into his hands, blocking out his bedroom, trying to hold on to the picture of that dimly lit room, but it was like trying to keep water in his cupped hands; the details were now trickling away as fast as he tried to hold on to them...Voldemort and Wormtail had been talking about someone they had killed, though Harry could not remember the name...and they had been plotting to kill someone else...him!\\n',\n",
       " '\\tHarry took his face out of his hands, opened his eyes, and stared around his bedroom as though expecting to see something unusual there.  As it happened, there was an extraordinary number of unusual things in this room.  A large wooden trunk stood open at the foot of his bed, revealing a cauldron, broomstick, black robes, and assorted spellbooks.  Rolls of parchment littered that part of his desk that was not taken up by the large, empty cage in which his snowy owl, Hedwig, usually perched.  On the floor beside his bed a book lay open; Harry had been reading it before he fell asleep last night.  The pictures in this book were all moving.  Men in bright orange robes were zooming in and out of sight on broomsticks, throwing a red ball to one another.\\n',\n",
       " \"\\tHarry walked over to the book, picked it up, and watched on of the wizards score a spectacular goal by putting the ball through a fifty-foot-high hoop.  Then he snapped the book shut.  Even Quidditch -- in Harry's opinion, the best sport in the world -- couldn't distract him at the moment.  He placed Flying with the Cannons on his bedside table, crossed to the window, and drew back the curtains to survey the street below.\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\tPrivet Drive looked exactly as a respectable suburban street would be expected to look inthe early hours of Saturday morning.  All the curtains were closed.  As far as Harry could see through the darkness, there wasn't a living creature in sight, not even a cat.\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\tAnd yet...and yet...Harry went restlessly back to the bed and sat down on it, running a finger over his scar again.  It wasn't the pain that bothered him; Harry was no stranger to pain and injury.  He had lost all the bones from his right arm once and had them painfully regrown in a night.  The same arm had been pierced by a venemous foot-long fang not long afterward.  Only last year Harry had fallen fifty feet from an airborn broomstick.  He was used to bizarre accidents and injuries; they were unavoidable if you attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and had a knack for attracting a lot of trouble.\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\tNo, the thing that was bothering Harry was the last time his scar had hurt him, it had been because Voldemort had been close by...But Voldemort couldn't be here, now...The idea of Voldemort lurking in Privet Drive was absurd, impossible...\\n\",\n",
       " '\\tHarry listened closely to the silence around him.  Was he half expecting to hear the creak of a stair or the swish of a cloak?  And then he jumped slightly as he heard his cousin Dudley give a tremendous grunting snore from the next room.\\n',\n",
       " '\\tHarry shook himself mentally; he was being stupid.  There was no one in the house with him except Uncle Vernon, Aunt Petunia, and Dudley, and they were plainly still asleep, their dreams untroubled and painless.\\n',\n",
       " \"\\tAsleep was the way Harry liked the Dursleys best; it wasn't as though they were ever any help to him awake.  Uncle Vernon, Aunt Petunia, and Dudley were Harry's only living relatives.  They were Muggles who hated and despised magic in any form, which meant that Harry was about as welcome in their house as dry rot.  They had explained away Harry's long absences at Hogwarts over the last three years by telling everyone that he went to St. Brutus's Secure Center for Incurably Criminal Boys.  They knew perfectly well that, as an underage wizard, Harry wasn't allowed to use magic outside Hogwarts, but they were still apt to blame him for anything that went wrong about the house.  Harry had never been able to confide in them or tell them anything about his life in the wizarding world.  The very idea of going to them when they awoke, and telling them about his scar hurting him, and about his worries about Voldemort, was laughable.\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\tAnd yet it was because of Voldemort that Harry had come to live with the Dursleys in the first place.  If it hadn't been for Voldemort, Harry would not have had the lightning scar on his forehead.  If it hadn't been for Voldemort, Harry would still have had parents...\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\tHarry had been a year old the night that Voldemort -- the most powerful Dark wizard for a century, a wizard who had been gaining power steadily for eleven years -- arrived at his house and killed his father and mother.  Voldemort had then turned his wand on Harry; he had performed the curse that had disposed of many full-grown witches and wizards in his steady rise to power -- and, incredibly, it had not worked.  Instead of killing the small boy, the curse had rebounded upon Voldemort.  Harry had survived with nothing but a lightning-shaped cut on his forehead, and Voldemort had been reduced to something barely alive.  His powers gone, his life almost extinguished, Voldemort had fled; the terror in which the secret community of witches and wizards had lived for so long had lifted, Voldemort's followers had disbanded, and Harry Potter had become famous.\\n\",\n",
       " '\\tIt had been enough of a shock for Harry to discover, on his eleventh birthday, that he was a wizard; it had been even more disconcerting to find out that everyone in the hidden wizarding world knew his name.  Harry had arrived at Hogwarts to find that heads turned and whispers followed him wherever he went.  But he was used to it now:  At the end of this summer, he would be starting his fourth year at Hogwarts, and Harry was already counting the days until he would be back at the castle again.\\n',\n",
       " '\\tBut there was still a fortnight to go before he went back to school.  He looked hopelessly around his room again, and his eye paused on the birthday cards his two best friends had sent him at the end of July.  What would they say if Harry wrote to them and told them about his scar hurting?\\n',\n",
       " \"\\tAt once, Hermione Granger's voice seemed to fill his head, shrill and panicky.\\n\",\n",
       " '\\t\"Your scar hurt?  Harry, that\\'s really serious.... Write to Professor Dumbledore! And I\\'ll go and check Common Magical Ailments and Afflictions.... Maybe there\\'s something in there about curse scars. . . .\"\\n',\n",
       " \"\\tYes, that would be Hermione's advice:  Go straight to the headmaster of Hogwarts, and in the meantime, consult a book.  Harry stared out of the window at the inky blue-black sky. He doubted very much whether a book could help him now.  As far as he knew, he was the only living person to have survived a curse like Voldemort's; it was highly unlikely, therefore, that he would find his symptoms listed in Common Magical Ailments and Afflictions.  As for informing the headmaster, Harry had no idea where Dumbledore went during the summer holidays.  He amused himself for a moment, picturing Dumbledore, with his long silver beard, full length wizard's robes, and pointed hat, stretched out on a beach somewhere, rubbing suntan lotion onto his long crooked nose.  Wherever Dumbledore was, though, Harry was sure that Hedwig would be able to find him; Harry's owl had never yet failed to deliver a letter to anyone, even without an address.  But what would he write?\\n\",\n",
       " '\\tDear Professor Dumbledore, Sorry to bother you, but my scar hurt this morning.  Yours sincerely, Harry Potter.\\n',\n",
       " '\\tEven inside his head the words sounded stupid.\\n',\n",
       " \"\\tAnd so he tried to imagine his other best friend, Ron Weasley's, reaction, and in a moment, Ron's red hair and long-nosed, freckled face seemed to swim before Harry, wearing a bemused expression.\\n\",\n",
       " '\\t\"Your scar hurt? But ... but You-Know-Who can\\'t be near you now, can he? I mean ... you\\'d know, wouldn\\'t you? He\\'d be trying to do you in again, wouldn\\'t be? I dunno, Harry, maybe curse scars always twinge a bit... I\\'ll ask Dad. . . .\"\\n',\n",
       " \"\\tMr. Weasley was a fully qualified wizard who worked in the Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office at the Ministry of Magic, but he didn't have any particular expertise in the matter of curses, as far as Harry knew.  In any case, Harry didn't like the idea of the whole Weasley family knowing that he, Harry, was getting jumpy about a few moments' pain.  Mrs. Weasley would fuss worse than Hermione, and Fred and George, Ron's sixteen- year-old twin brothers, might think Harry was losing his nerve.  The Weasleys were Harry's favorite family in the world; he was hoping that they might invite him to stay any time now (Ron had mentioned something about the Quidditch World Cup), and he somehow didn't want his visit punctuated with anxious inquiries about his scar.\\n\",\n",
       " '\\tHarry kneaded his forehead with his knuckles. What he really wanted (and it felt almost shameful to admit it to himself) was someone like - someone like a parent: an adult wizard whose advice he could ask without feeling stupid, someone who cared about him, who had had experience with Dark Magic....\\n',\n",
       " \"\\tAnd then the solution came to him. It was so simple, and so obvious, that he couldn't believe it had taken so long - Sirius.\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\tHarry leapt up from the bed, hurried across the room, and sat down at his desk; he pulled a piece of parchment toward him, loaded his eagle-feather quill with ink, wrote Dear Sirius, then paused, wondering how best to phrase his problem, still marveling at the fact that he hadn't thought of Sirius straight away.  But then, perhaps it wasn't so surprising - after all, he had only found out that Sirius was his godfather two months ago.\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\tThere was a simple reason for Sirius's complete absence from Harry's life until then - Sirius had been in Azkaban, the terrifying wizard jail guarded by creatures called dementors, sightless, soul-sucking fiends who had come to search for Sirius at Hogwarts when he had escaped.  Yet Sirius had been innocent - the murders for which he had been convicted had been committed by Wormtail, Voldemort's supporter, whom nearly everybody now believed dead.  Harry, Ron, and Hermione knew otherwise, however; they had come face-to-face with Wormtail only the previous year, though only Professor Dumbledore had believed their story.\\n\",\n",
       " '\\tFor one glorious hour, Harry had believed that he was leaving the Dursleys at last, because Sirius had offered him a home once his name had been cleared.  But the chance had been snatched away from him - Wormtail had escaped before they could take him to the Ministry of Magic, and Sirius had had to flee for his life.  Harry had helped him escape on the back of a hippogriff called Buckbeak, and since then, Sirius had been on the run.  The home Harry might have had if Wormtail had not escaped had been haunting him all summer.  It had been doubly hard to return to the Dursleys knowing that he had so nearly escaped them forever.\\n',\n",
       " \"\\tNevertheless, Sirius had been of some help to Harry, even if he couldn't be with him.  It was due to Sirius that Harry now had all his school things in his bedroom with him.  The Dursleys had never allowed this before; their general wish of keeping Harry as miserable as possible, coupled with their fear of his powers, had led them to lock his school trunk in the cupboard under the stairs every summer prior to this.  But their attitude had changed since they had found out that Harry had a dangerous murderer for a godfather - for Harry had conveniently forgotten to tell them that Sirius was innocent.\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\tHarry had received two letters from Sirius since he had been back at Privet Drive.  Both had been delivered, not by owls (as was usual with wizards), but by large, brightly colored tropical birds.  Hedwig had not approved of these flashy intruders; she had been most reluctant to allow them to drink from her water tray before flying off again.  Harry, on the other hand, had liked them; they put him in mind of palm trees and white sand, and he hoped that, wherever Sirius was (Sirius never said, in case the letters were intercepted), he was enjoying himself.  Somehow, Harry found it hard to imaging dementors surviving for long in bright sunlight, perhapse that was why Sirius had gone South.  Sirius's letters, which were now hidden beneath the highly useful loose floorboards under Harry's bed, sounded chearful, and in both of them he had reminded Harry to call on him if ever Harry needed to.  Well, he needed to right now, all right...\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\tHarry's lamp seemed to grow dimmer as the cold gray light that precedes sunrise slowly crept into the room. Finally, when the sun had risen, when his bedroom walls had turned gold, and when sounds of movement could be heard from Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia's room, Harry cleared his desk of crumpled pieces of parchment and reread his finished letter.\\n\",\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " 'Dear Sirius,\\n',\n",
       " \"\\tThanks for your last letter. That bird was enormous; it could hardly get through my window. Things are the same as usual here. Dudley's diet isn't going too well. My aunt found him smuggling doughnuts into his room yesterday. They told him they'd have to cut his pocket money if he keeps doing it, so he got really angry and chucked his PlayStation out of the window. That's a sort of computer thing you can play games on. Bit stupid really, now he hasn't even got Mega-Mutilation Part Three to take his mind off things.\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\tI'm okay, mainly because the Dursleys are terrified you might turn up and turn them all into bats if I ask you to.\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\tA weird thing happened this morning, though. My scar hurt again. Last time that happened it was because Voldemort was at Hogwarts. But I don't reckon he can be anywhere near me now, can he? Do you know if curse scars sometimes hurt years afterward?\\n\",\n",

       " '\\n',\n",
       " \"Yes, thought Harry, that looked all right.  There was no point putting in the dream; he didn't want it to look as though he was too worried.  He folded up the parchment and laid it aside on his desk, ready for when Hedwig returned.  Then he got to his feet, stretched, and opened his wardrobe once more. Without glancing at his reflection he started to get dressed before going down to breakfast.\\n\",\n",

       " '\\n',\n",
       " \"            By the time Harry arrived in the kitchen, the three Dursleys were already seated around the table.  None of them looked up as he entered or sat down.  Uncle Vernon's large red face was hidden behind the morning's Daily Mail, and Aunt Petunia was cutting a grapefruit into quarters, her lips pursed over her horselike teeth.\\n\",\n",
       " '            Dudley looked furious and sulky, and somehow seemed to be taking up even more space than usual.  This was saying something, as he always took up an entire side of the square table by himself.  When Aunt Petunia put a quarter of unsweetened grapefruit onto Dudley\\'s plate with a tremulous \"There you are, Diddy darling,\" Dudley glowered at her.  His life had taken a most unpleasant turn since he had come home for the summer with his end-of-year report.\\n',\n",
       " '            Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia had managed to find excuses for his bad marks as usual:  Aunt Petunia always insisted that Dudley was a very gifted boy whose teachers didn\\'t understand him, while Uncle Vernon maintained that \"he didn\\'t want some swotty little nancy boy for a son anyway.\"  They also skated over the accusations of bullying in the report - \"He\\'s a boisterous little boy, but he wouldn\\'t hurt a fly!\" Aunt Petunia had said tearfully.\\n',\n",
       " \"However, at the bottom of the report there were a few well-chosen comments from the school nurse that not even Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia could explain away.  No matter how much Aunt Petunia wailed that Dudley was big-boned, and that his poundage was really puppy fat, and that he was a growing boy who needed plenty of food, the fact remained that the school outfitters didn't stock knickerbockers big enough for him anymore.  The school nurse had seen what Aunt Petunia's eyes - so sharp when it came to spotting fingerprints on her gleaming walls, and in observing the comings and goings of the neighbors - simply refused to see:  that far from needing extra nourishment, Dudley had reached roughly the size and weight of a young killer whale.\\n\",\n",
       " 'So - after many tantrums, after arguments that shook Harry\\'s bedroom floor, and many tears from Aunt Petunia - the new regime had begun.  The diet sheet that had been sent by the Smeltings school nurse had been taped to the fridge, which had been emptied of all Dudley\\'s favorite things - fizzy drinks and cakes, chocolate bars and burgers and filled instead with fruit and vegetables and the sorts of things that Uncle Vernon called \"rabbit food.\"  To make Dudley feel better about it all, Aunt Petunia had insisted that the whole family follow the diet too.  She now passed a grapefruit quarter to Harry. He noticed that it was a lot smaller than Dudley\\'s.  Aunt Petunia seemed to feet that the best way to keep up Dudley\\'s morale was to make sure that he did, at least, get more to eat than Harry.\\n',\n",
       " \"But Aunt Petunia didn't know what was hidden under the loose floorboard upstairs.  She had no idea that Harry was not following the diet at all.  The moment he had got wind of the fact that he was expected to survive the summer on carrot sticks, Harry had sent Hedwig to his friends with pleas for help, and they had risen to the occasion magnificently.  Hedwig had returned from Hermione's house with a large box stuffed full of sugar-free snacks.  (Hermione's parents were dentists.)  Hagrid, the Hogwarts gamekeeper, had obliged with a sack full of his own homemade rock cakes.  (Harry hadn't touched these; he had had too much experience of Hagrid's cooking.)  Mrs. Weasley, however, had sent the family owl, Errol, with an enormous fruitcake and assorted meat pies.  Poor Errol, who was elderly and feeble, had needed a full five days to recover from the journey.  And then on Harry's birthday (which the Dursleys had completely ignored) he had received four superb birthday cakes, one each from Ron, Hermione, Hagrid, and Sirius.  Harry still had two of them left, and so, looking forward to a real breakfast when he got back upstairs, he ate his grapefruit without complaint.\\n\",\n",
       " 'Uncle Vernon laid aside his paper with a deep sniff of disapproval and looked down at his own grapefruit quarter.\\n',\n",
       " '\"Is this it?\" he said grumpily to Aunt Petunia.\\n',\n",
       " \"Aunt Petunia gave him a severe look, and then nodded pointedly at Dudley, who had already finished his own grapefruit quarter and was eyeing Harry's with a very sour look in his piggy little eyes.\\n\",\n",
       " 'Uncle Vernon gave a great sigh, which ruffled his large, bushy mustache, and picked up his spoon.\\n',\n",
       " \"The doorbell rang.  Uncle Vernon heaved himself out of his chair and set off down the hall.  Quick as a flash, while his mother was occupied with the kettle, Dudley stole the rest of Uncle Vernon's grapefruit.\\n\",\n",
       " 'Harry heard talking at the door, and someone laughing, and Uncle Vernon answering curtly.  Then the front door closed, and the sound of ripping paper came from the hall.\\n',\n",
       " \"Aunt Petunia set the teapot down on the table and looked curiously around to see where Uncle Vernon had got to.  She didn't have to wait long to find out; after about a minute, he was back.  He looked livid.\\n\",\n",
       " '\"You,\" he barked at Harry.  \"In the living room.  Now.\"\\n',\n",
       " 'Bewildered, wondering what on earth he was supposed to have done this time, Harry got up and followed Uncle Vernon out of the kitchen and into the next room.  Uncle Vernon closed the door sharply behind both of them.\\n',\n",
       " '\"So,\" he said, marching over to the fireplace and turning to face Harry as though he were about to pronounce him under arrest.  \"So.\"\\n',\n",
       " 'Harry would have dearly loved to have said, \"So what?\" but he didn\\'t feel that Uncle Vernon\\'s temper should be tested this early in the morning, especially when it was already under severe strain from lack of food.  He therefore settled for looking politely puzzled.\\n',\n",
       " '\"This just arrived,\" said Uncle Vernon.  He brandished a piece of purple writing paper at Harry.  \"A letter.  About you.\"\\n',\n",
       " \"Harry's confusion increased.  Who would be writing to Uncle Vernon about him?  Who did he know who sent letters by the postman?\\n\",\n",
       " 'Uncle Vernon glared at Harry, then looked down at the letter and began to read aloud:\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " 'Dear Mr. and Mrs. Dursley,\\n',\n",
       " 'We have never been introduced, but I am sure you have heard a great deal from Harry about my son Ron.\\n',\n",
       " 'As Harry might have told you, the final of the Quidditch World Cup takes place this Monday night, and my husband, Arthur, has just managed to get prime tickets through his connections at the Department of Magical Games and Sports.\\n',\n",
       " \"I do hope you will allow us to take Harry to the match, as this really is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity; Britain hasn't hosted the cup for thirty years, and tickets are extremely hard to come by.  We would of course be glad to have Harry stay for the remainder of the summer holidays, and to see him safely onto the train back to school.\\n\",\n",
       " 'It would be best for Harry to send us your answer as quickly as possible in the normal way, because the Muggle postman has never delivered to our house, and I am not sure he even knows where it is.\\n',\n",
       " 'Hoping to see Harry soon,\\n',\n",
       " 'Yours sincerely,\\n',\n",
       " 'Molly Weasley\\n',\n",

       " '\\n',\n",
       " 'Uncle Vernon finished reading, put his hand back into his breast pocket, and drew out something else.\\n',\n",
       " '\"Look at this,\" he growled.\\n',\n",
       " \"He held up the envelope in which Mrs. Weasley's letter had come, and Harry had to fight down a laugh.  Every bit of it was covered in stamps except for a square inch on the front, into which Mrs. Weasley had squeezed the Dursleys' address in minute writing.\\n\",\n",
       " '\"She did put enough stamps on, then,\" said Harry, trying to sound as though Mrs. Weasley\\'s was a mistake anyone could make.  His uncle\\'s eyes flashed.\\n',\n",
       " '\"The postman noticed,\" he said through gritted teeth. \"Very interested to know where this letter came from, he was.  That\\'s why he rang the doorbell.  Seemed to think it was funny.\"\\n',\n",
       " \"Harry didn't say anything.  Other people might not understand why Uncle Vernon was making a fuss about too many stamps, but Harry had lived with the Dursleys too long not to know how touchy they were about anything even slightly out of the ordinary.  Their worst fear was that someone would find out that they were connected (however distantly) with people like Mrs. Weasley.\\n\",\n",
       " \"Uncle Vernon was still glaring at Harry, who tried to keep his expression neutral.  If he didn't do or say anything stupid, he might just be in for the treat of a lifetime.  He waited for Uncle Vernon to say something, but he merely continued to glare.  Harry decided to break the silence.\\n\",\n",
       " '\"So - can I go then?\" he asked.\\n',\n",
       " \"A slight spasm crossed Uncle Vernon's large purple face.  The mustache bristled. Harry thought he knew what was going on behind the mustache: a furious battle as two of Uncle Vernon's most fundamental instincts came into conflict.  Allowing Harry to go would make Harry happy, something Uncle Vernon had struggled against for thirteen years.  On the other hand, allowing Harry to disappear to the Weasleys' for the rest of the summer would get rid of him two weeks earlier than anyone could have hoped, and Uncle Vernon hated having Harry in the house.  To give himself thinking time, it seemed, he looked down at Mrs. Weasley's letter again.\\n\",\n",
       " '\"Who is this woman?\" he said, staring at the signature with distaste.\\n',\n",
       " '\"You\\'ve seen her,\" said Harry. \"She\\'s my friend Ron\\'s mother, she was meeting him off the Hog - off the school train at the end of last term.\"\\n',\n",
       " 'He had almost said \"Hogwarts Express,\" and that was a sure way to get his uncle\\'s temper up.  Nobody ever mentioned the name of Harry\\'s school aloud in the Dursley household.\\n',\n",
       " 'Uncle Vernon screwed up his enormous face as though trying to remember something very unpleasant.\\n',\n",
       " '\"Dumpy sort of woman?\" he growled finally.  \"Load of children with red hair?\"\\n',\n",
       " 'Harry frowned.  He thought it was a bit rich of Uncle Vernon to call anyone \"dumpy,\" when his own son, Dudley, had finally achieved what he\\'d been threatening to do since the age of three, and become wider than he was tall.\\n',\n",
       " 'Uncle Vernon was perusing the letter again.\\n',\n",
       " '\"Quidditch,\" he muttered under his breath. \"Quidditch - what is this rubbish?\"\\n',\n",
       " 'Harry felt a second stab of annoyance.\\n',\n",
       " '\"It\\'s a sport,\" he said shortly. \"Played on broom- \"\\n',\n",
       " '\"All right, all right!\"  said Uncle Vernon loudly.  Harry saw, with some satisfaction, that his uncle looked vaguely panicky.  Apparently his nerves couldn\\'t stand the sound of the word \"broomsticks\" in his living room.  He took refuge in perusing the letter again.  Harry saw his lips form the words \"send us your answer ... in the normal way.\"  He scowled.\\n',\n",
       " '\"What does she mean, \\'the normal way\\'?\"  he spat.\\n',\n",
       " '\"Normal for us,\" said Harry, and before his uncle could stop him, he added, \"you know, owl post. That\\'s what\\'s normal for wizards.\"\\n',\n",
       " 'Uncle Vernon looked as outraged as if Harry had just uttered a disgusting swearword. Shaking with anger, he shot a nervous look through the window, as though expecting to see some of the neighbors with their ears pressed against the glass.\\n',\n",
       " '\"How many times do I have to tell you not to mention that unnaturalness under my roof?\"  he hissed, his face now a rich plum color.  \"You stand there, in the clothes Petunia and I have put on your ungrateful back -\"\\n',\n",
       " '\"Only after Dudley finished with them,\" said Harry coldly, and indeed, he was dressed in a sweatshirt so large for him that he had had to roll back the sleeves five times so as to be able to use his hands, and which fell past the knees of his extremely baggy jeans.\\n',\n",
       " '\"I will not be spoken to like that!\"  said Uncle Vernon, trembling with rage.\\n',\n",
       " 'But Harry wasn\\'t going to stand for this.  Gone were the days when he had been forced to take every single one of the Dursleys\\' stupid rules.  He wasn\\'t following Dudley\\'s diet, and he wasn\\'t going to let Uncle Vernon stop him from going to the Quidditch World Cup, not if he could help it.  Harry took a deep, steadying breath and then said, \"Okay, I can\\'t see the World Cup.  Can I go now, then?  Only I\\'ve got a letter to Sirius I want to finish.  You know - my godfather.\"\\n',\n",
       " \"He had done it, he had said the magic words.  Now he watched the purple recede blotchily from Uncle Vernon's face, making it look like badly mixed black currant ice cream.\\n\",\n",
       " '\"You\\'re - you\\'re writing to him, are you?\"  said Uncle Vernon, in a would-be calm voice - but Harry had seen the pupils of his tiny eyes contract with sudden fear.\\n',\n",
       " '\"Well - yeah,\" said Harry, casually.  \"It\\'s been a while since he heard from me, and, you know, if he doesn\\'t he might start thinking something\\'s wrong.\"\\n',\n",
       " \"He stopped there to enjoy the effect of these words.  He could almost see the cogs working under Uncle Vernon's thick, dark, neatly parted hair.  If he tried to stop Harry writing to Sirius, Sirius would think Harry was being mistreated.  If he told Harry he couldn't go to the Quidditch World Cup, Harry would write and tell Sirius, who would know Harry was being mistreated.  There was only one thing for Uncle Vernon to do.  Harry could see the conclusion forming in his uncle's mind as though the great mustached face were transparent.  Harry tried not to smile, to keep his own face as blank as possible. And then -\\n\",\n",
       " '\"Well, all right then.  You can go to this ruddy ... this stupid ... this World Cup thing. You write and tell these - these Weasleys they\\'re to pick you up, mind.  I haven\\'t got time to go dropping you off all over the country.  And you can spend the rest of the summer there.  And you can tell your - your godfather ... tell him ... tell him you\\'re going.\"\\n',\n",
       " '\"Okay then,\" said Harry brightly.\\n',\n",
       " \"He turned and walked toward the living room door, fighting the urge to jump into the air and whoop.  He was going ... he was going to the Weasleys', he was going to watch the Quidditch World Cup!\\n\",\n",
       " \"Outside in the hall he nearly ran into Dudley, who had been lurking behind the door, clearly hoping to overhear Harry being told off.  He looked shocked to see the broad grin on Harry's face.\\n\",\n",
       " '\"That was an excellent breakfast, wasn\\'t it?\" said Harry.  \"I feel really full, don\\'t you?\"\\n',\n",
       " \"Laughing at the astonished look on Dudley's face, Harry took the stairs three at a time, and hurled himself back into his bedroom.\\n\",\n",
       " 'The first thing he saw was that Hedwig was back.  She was sitting in her cage, staring at Harry with her enormous amber eyes, and clicking her beak in the way that meant she was annoyed about something.  Exactly what was annoying her became apparent almost at once.\\n',\n",
       " '\"OUCH!\" said Harry as what appeared to be a small, gray, feathery tennis ball collided with the side of his head.  Harry massaged the spot furiously, looking up to see what had hit him, and saw a minute owl, small enough to fit into the palm of his hand, whizzing excitedly around the room like a loose firework.  Harry then realized that the owl had dropped a letter at his feet.  Harry bent down, recognized Ron\\'s handwriting, then tore open the envelope.  Inside was a hastily scribbled note.\\n',\n",

       " \"By twelve o'clock the next day, Harry's school trunk was packed with his school things and all his most prized possessions - the Invisibility Cloak he had inherited from his father, the broomstick he had gotten from Sirius, the enchanted map of Hogwarts he had been given by Fred and George Weasley last year.  He had emptied his hiding place under the loose floorboard of all food, double-checked every nook and cranny of his bedroom for forgotten spellbooks or quills, and taken down the chart on the wall counting down the days to September the first, on which he liked to cross off the days remaining until his return to Hogwarts.\\n\",\n",
       " \"The atmosphere inside number four, Privet Drive was extremely tense. The imminent arrival at their house of an assortment of wizards was making the Dursleys uptight and irritable. Uncle Vernon had looked downright alarmed when Harry informed him that the Weasleys would be arriving at five o'clock the very next day.\\n\",\n",
       " '\"I hope you told them to dress properly, these people,\" he snarled at once.  \"I\\'ve seen the sort of stuff your lot wear.  They\\'d better have the decency to put on normal clothes, that\\'s all.\"\\n',\n",
       " 'Harry felt a slight sense of foreboding. He had rarely seen Mr. or Mrs. Weasley wearing anything that the Dursleys would call \"normal.\"  Their children might don Muggle clothing during the holidays, but Mr. and Mrs. Weasley usually wore long robes in varying states of shabbiness.  Harry wasn\\'t bothered about what the neighbors would think, but he was anxious about how rude the Dursleys might be to the Weasleys if they turned up looking like their worst idea of wizards.\\n',\n",
       " \"Uncle Vernon had put on his best suit.  To some people, this might have looked like a gesture of welcome, but Harry knew it was because Uncle Vernon wanted to look impressive and intimidating.  Dudley, on the other hand, looked somehow diminished.  This was not because the diet was at last taking effect, but due to fright.  Dudley had emerged from his last encounter with a fully grown wizard with a curly pig's tail poking out of the seat of his trousers, and Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon had had to pay for its removal at a private hospital in London.  It wasn't altogether surprising, therefore, that Dudley kept running his hand nervously over his backside, and walking sideways from room to room, so as not to present the same target to the enemy.\\n\",\n",
       " \"Lunch was an almost silent meal.  Dudley didn't even protest at the food (cottage cheese and grated celery).  Aunt Petunia wasn't, eating anything at all.  Her arms were folded, her lips were pursed, and she seemed to be chewing her tongue, as though biting back the furious diatribe she longed to throw at Harry.\\n\",\n",
       " '\"They\\'ll be driving, of course?\" Uncle Vernon barked across the table.\\n',\n",
       " '\"Er,\" said Harry.\\n',\n",
       " \"He hadn't thought of that. How were the Weasleys going to pick him up?  They didn't have a car anymore; the old Ford Anglia they had once owned was currently running wild in the Forbidden Forest at Hogwarts.  But Mr. Weasley had borrowed a Ministry of Magic car last year; possibly he would do the same today?\\n\",\n",
       " '\"I think so,\" said Harry.\\n',\n",
       " 'Uncle Vernon snorted into his mustache.  Normally, Uncle Vernon would have asked what car Mr. Weasley drove; he tended to judge other men by how big and expensive their cars were.  But Harry doubted whether Uncle Vernon would have taken to Mr. Weasley even if he drove a Ferrari.\\n',\n",
       " \"Harry spent most of the afternoon in his bedroom; he couldn't stand watching Aunt Petunia peer out through the net curtains every few seconds, as though there had been a warning about an escaped rhinoceros.  Finally, at a quarter to five, Harry went back downstairs and into the living room.\\n\",\n",
       " \"Aunt Petunia was compulsively straightening cushions.  Uncle Vernon was pretending to read the paper, but his tiny eyes were not moving, and Harry was sure he was really listening with all his might for the sound of an approaching car.  Dudley was crammed into an armchair, his porky hands beneath him, clamped firmly around his bottom.  Harry couldn't take the tension; he left the room and went and sat on the stairs in the hall, his eyes on his watch and his heart pumping fast from excitement and nerves.\\n\",\n",
       " \"But five o'clock came and then went. Uncle Vernon, perspiring slightly in his suit, opened the front door, peered up and down the street, then withdrew his head quickly.\\n\",\n",
       " '\"They\\'re late!\" he snarled at Harry.\\n',\n",
       " 'I know,\" said Harry.  \"Maybe - er - the traffic\\'s bad, or something.\"\\n',\n",
       " 'Ten past five ... then a quarter past five ... Harry was starting to feel anxious himself now.  At half past, he heard Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia conversing in terse mutters in the living room.\\n',\n",
       " '\"No consideration at all.\"\\n',\n",
       " '\"We might\\'ve had an engagement.\"\\n',\n",
       " '\"Maybe they think they\\'ll get invited to dinner if they\\'re late.\"\\n',\n",
       " '\"Well, they most certainly won\\'t be,\" said Uncle Vernon, and Harry heard him stand up and start pacing the living room.  \"They\\'ll take the boy and go, there\\'ll be no hanging around. That\\'s if they\\'re coming at all.  Probably mistaken the day.  I daresay their kind don\\'t set much store by punctuality.  Either that or they drive some tin-pot car that\\'s broken d- AAAAAAAARRRRRGH!\"\\n',\n",
       " 'Harry jumped up.  From the other side of the living room door came the sounds of the three Dursleys scrambling, panic-stricken, across the room.  Next moment Dudley came flying into the hall, looking terrified.\\n',\n",
       " '\"What happened?\" said Harry.  \"What\\'s the matter?\"\\n',\n",
       " \"But Dudley didn't seem able to speak.  Hands still clamped over his buttocks, he waddled as fast as he could into the kitchen.  Harry hurried into the living room.\\n\",\n",

       " '\"What is it?\" gasped Aunt Petunia, who had backed into the wall and was staring, terrified, toward the fire.  \"What is it, Vernon?\"\\n',\n",
       " 'But they were left in doubt barely a second longer.  Voices could be heard from inside the blocked fireplace.\\n',\n",

       " '\"They - they\\'ve tried to get here by Floo powder,\" said Harry, fighting a mad desire to laugh.  \"They can travel by fire - only you\\'ve blocked the fireplace - hang on -\"\\n',\n",
       " 'He approached the fireplace and called through the boards.\\n',\n",
       " '\"Mr. Weasley?  Can you hear me?\"\\n',\n",

       " '\"They\\'ve got an electric fire,\" Harry explained.\\n',\n",
       " '\"Really?\" said Mr. Weasley\\'s voice excitedly.  \"Eclectic, you say?  With a plug? Gracious, I must see that.... Let\\'s think ... ouch, Ron!\"\\n',\n",
       " \"Ron's voice now joined the others'.\\n\",\n",
       " '\"What are we doing here?  Has something gone wrong?\"\\n',\n",
       " '\"Oh no, Ron,\" came Fred\\'s voice, very sarcastically.  \"No, this is exactly where we wanted to end up.\"\\n',\n",
       " '\"Yeah, we\\'re having the time of our lives here,\" said George, whose voice sounded muffled, as though he was squashed against the wall.\\n',\n",
       " '\"Boys, boys. . .\" said Mr. Weasley vaguely.  \"I\\'m trying to think what to do.... Yes ... only way. . . Stand back, Harry.\"\\n',\n",
       " 'Harry retreated to the sofa.  Uncle Vernon, however, moved forward.\\n',\n",
       " '\"Wait a moment!\" he bellowed at the fire.  \"What exactly are you going to -\"\\n',\n",
       " 'BANG.\\n',\n",
       " 'The electric fire shot across the room as the boarded-up fireplace burst outward, expelling Mr. Weasley, Fred, George, and Ron in a cloud of rubble and loose chippings.  Aunt Petunia shrieked and fell backward over the coffee table; Uncle Vernon caught her before she hit the floor, and gaped, speechless, at the Weasleys, all of whom had bright red hair, including Fred and George, who were identical to the last freckle.\\n',\n",
       " '\"That\\'s better,\" panted Mr. Weasley, brushing dust from his long green robes and straightening his glasses.  \"Ah - you must be Harry\\'s aunt and uncle!\"\\n',\n",
       " 'Tall, thin, and balding, he moved toward Uncle Vernon, his hand outstretched, but Uncle Vernon backed away several paces, dragging Aunt Petunia.  Words utterly failed Uncle Vernon.  His best suit was covered in white dust, which had settled in his hair and mustache and made him look as though he had just aged thirty years.\\n',\n",
       " '\"Er - yes - sorry about that,\" said Mr. Weasley, lowering his hand and looking over his shoulder at the blasted fireplace.  \"It\\'s all my fault.  It just didn\\'t occur to me that we wouldn\\'t be able to get out at the other end.  I had your fireplace connected to the Floo Network, you see - just for an afternoon, you know, so we could get Harry.  Muggle fireplaces aren\\'t supposed to be connected, strictly speaking - but I\\'ve got a useful contact at the Floo Regulation Panel and he fixed it for me.  I can put it right in a jiffy, though, don\\'t worry.  I\\'ll light a fire to send the boys back, and then I can repair your fireplace before I Disapparate.\"\\n',\n",
       " \"Harry was ready to bet that the Dursleys hadn't understood a single word of this.  They were still gaping at Mr. Weasley, thunderstruck.  Aunt Petunia staggered upright again and hid behind Uncle Vernon.\\n\",\n",
       " '\"Hello, Harry!\" said Mr. Weasley brightly.  \"Got your trunk ready?\"\\n',\n",
       " '\"It\\'s upstairs,\" said Harry, grinning back.\\n',\n",
       " '\"We\\'ll get it,\" said Fred at once.  Winking at Harry, he and George left the room.  They knew where Harry\\'s bedroom was, having once rescued him from it in the dead of night.  Harry suspected that Fred and George were hoping for a glimpse of Dudley; they had heard a lot about him from Harry.\\n',\n",
       " '\"Well,\" said Mr. Weasley, swinging his arms slightly, while he tried to find words to break the very nasty silence.  \"Very - erm - very nice place you\\'ve got here.\"\\n',\n",
       " \"As the usually spotless living room was now covered in dust and bits of brick, this remark didn't go down too well with the Dursleys.  Uncle Vernon's face purpled once more, and Aunt Petunia started chewing her tongue again.  However, they seemed too scared to actually say anything.\\n\",\n",
       " 'Mr. Weasley was looking around.  He loved everything to do with Muggles.  Harry could see him itching to go and examine the television and the video recorder.\\n',\n",
       " '\"They run off eckeltricity, do they?\" he said knowledgeably. \"Ah yes, I can see the plugs. I collect plugs,\" he added to Uncle Vernon. \"And batteries. Got a very large collection of batteries. My wife thinks I\\'m mad, but there you are.\"\\n',\n",
       " 'Uncle Vernon clearly thought Mr. Weasley was mad too.  He moved ever so slightly to the right, screening Aunt Petunia from view, as though he thought Mr. Weasley might suddenly run at them and attack.\\n',\n",
       " \"Dudley suddenly reappeared in the room.  Harry could hear the clunk of his trunk on the stairs, and knew that the sounds had scared Dudley out of the kitchen.  Dudley edged along the wall, gazing at Mr. Weasley with terrified eyes, and attempted to conceal himself behind his mother and father.  Unfortunately, Uncle Vernon's bulk, while sufficient to hide bony Aunt Petunia, was nowhere near enough to conceal Dudley.\\n\",\n",
       " '\"Ah, this is your cousin, is it, Harry?\" said Mr. Weasley, taking another brave stab at making conversation.\\n',\n",
       " '\"Yep,\" said Harry, \"that\\'s Dudley.\"\\n',\n",
       " \"He and Ron exchanged glances and then quickly looked away from each other; the temptation to burst out laughing was almost overwhelming.  Dudley was still clutching his bottom as though afraid it might fall off.  Mr. Weasley, however, seemed genuinely concerned at Dudley's peculiar behavior.  Indeed, from the tone of his voice when he next spoke, Harry was quite sure that Mr. Weasley thought Dudley was quite as mad as the Dursleys thought he was, except that Mr. Weasley felt sympathy rather than fear.\\n\",\n",
       " '\"Having a good holiday, Dudley?\" he said kindly.\\n',\n",
       " 'Dudley whimpered.  Harry saw his hands tighten still harder over his massive backside.\\n',\n",
       " \"Fred and George came back into the room carrying Harry's school trunk.  They glanced around as they entered and spotted Dudley.  Their faces cracked into identical evil grins.\\n\",\n",
       " '\"Ah, right,\" said Mr. Weasley.  \"Better get cracking then.\"\\n',\n",
       " 'He pushed up the sleeves of his robes and took out his wand.  Harry saw the Dursleys draw back against the wall as one.\\n',\n",
       " '\"Incendio!\" said Mr. Weasley, pointing his wand at the hole in the wall behind him.\\n',\n",
       " 'Flames rose at once in the fireplace, crackling merrily as though they had been burning for hours.  Mr. Weasley took a small drawstring bag from his pocket, untied it, took a pinch of the powder inside, and threw it onto the flames, which turned emerald green and roared higher than ever.\\n',\n",
       " '\"Off you go then, Fred,\" said Mr. Weasley.\\n',\n",
       " '\"Coming,\" said Fred.  \"Oh no - hang on -\"\\n',\n",
       " \"A bag of sweets had spilled out of Fred's pocket and the contents were now rolling in every direction - big, fat toffees in brightly colored wrappers.\\n\",\n",
       " 'Fred scrambled around, cramming them back into his pocket, then gave the Dursleys a cheery wave, stepped forward, and walked right into the fire, saying \"the Burrow!\"  Aunt Petunia gave a little shuddering gasp.  There was a whooshing sound, and Fred vanished.\\n',\n",
       " '\"Right then, George,\" said Mr. Weasley, \"you and the trunk.\"\\n',\n",
       " 'Harry helped George carry the trunk forward into the flames and turn it onto its end so that he could hold it better.  Then, with a second whoosh, George had cried \"the Burrow!\" and vanished too.\\n',\n",
       " '\"Ron, you next,\" said Mr. Weasley.\\n',\n",
       " '\"See you,\" said Ron brightly to the Dursleys.  He grinned broadly at Harry, then stepped into the fire, shouted \"the Burrow!\" and disappeared.\\n',\n",
       " 'Now Harry and Mr. Weasley alone remained.\\n',\n",
       " '\"Well . . . \\'bye then,\" Harry said to the Dursleys.\\n',\n",
       " \"They didn't say anything at all.  Harry moved toward the fire, but just as he reached the edge of the hearth, Mr. Weasley put out a hand and held him back.  He was looking at the Dursleys in amazement.\\n\",\n",
       " '\"Harry said good-bye to you,\" he said. \"Didn\\'t you hear him?\"\\n',\n",
       " '\"It doesn\\'t matter,\" Harry muttered to Mr. Weasley.  \"Honestly, I don\\'t care.\"\\n',\n",
       " \"Mr. Weasley did not remove his hand from Harry's shoulder.\\n\",\n",
       " '\"You aren\\'t going to see your nephew till next summer,\" he said to Uncle Vernon in mild indignation.  \"Surely you\\'re going to say good-bye?\"\\n',\n",
       " 'Uncle Vernon\\'s face worked furiously.  The idea of being taught consideration by a man who had just blasted away half his living room wall seemed to be causing him intense suffering. But Mr. Weasley\\'s wand was still in his hand, and Uncle Vernon\\'s tiny eyes darted to it once, before he said, very resentfully, \"Good-bye, then.\"\\n',\n",
       " '\"See you,\" said Harry, putting one foot forward into the green flames, which felt pleasantly like warm breath.  At that moment, however, a horrible gagging sound erupted behind him, and Aunt Petunia started to scream.\\n',\n",
       " \"Harry wheeled around. Dudley was no longer standing behind his parents. He was kneeling beside the coffee table, and he was gagging and sputtering on a foot-long, purple, slimy thing that was protruding from his mouth.  One bewildered second later, Harry realized that the foot-long thing was Dudley's tongue - and that a brightly colored toffee wrapper lay on the floor before him.\\n\",\n",
       " 'Aunt Petunia hurled herself onto the ground beside Dudley, seized the end of his swollen tongue, and attempted to wrench it out of his mouth; unsurprisingly, Dudley yelled and sputtered worse than ever, trying to fight her off. Uncle Vernon was bellowing and waving his arms around, and Mr. Weasley had to shout to make himself heard.\\n',\n",
       " '\"Not to worry, I can sort him out!\"  he yelled, advancing on Dudley with his wand outstretched, but Aunt Petunia screamed worse than ever and threw herself on top of Dudley, shielding him from Mr. Weasley.\\n',\n",
       " '\"No, really!\" said Mr. Weasley desperately.  \"It\\'s a simple process it was the toffee - my son Fred - real practical joker - but it\\'s only an Engorgement Charm - at least, I think it is - please, I can correct it -\"\\n',\n",
       " \"But far from being reassured, the Dursleys became more panic- stricken; Aunt Petunia was sobbing hysterically, tugging Dudley's tongue as though determined to rip it out; Dudley appeared to be suffocating under the combined pressure of his mother and his tongue; and Uncle Vernon, who had lost control completely, seized a china figure from on top of the sideboard and threw it very hard at Mr. Weasley, who ducked, causing the ornament to shatter in the blasted fireplace.\\n\",\n",
       " '\"Now really!\" said Mr. Weasley angrily, brandishing his wand.  \"I\\'m trying to help!\"\\n',\n",
       " 'Bellowing like a wounded hippo, Uncle Vernon snatched up another ornament.\\n',\n",

       " 'Harry didn\\'t want to miss the fun, but Uncle Vernon\\'s second ornament narrowly missed his left ear, and on balance he thought it best to leave the situation to Mr. Weasley.  He stepped into the fire, looking over his shoulder as he said \"the Burrow!\"  His last fleeting glimpse of the living room was of Mr. Weasley blasting a third ornament out of Uncle Vernon\\'s hand with his wand, Aunt Petunia screaming and lying on top of Dudley, and Dudley\\'s tongue lolling around like a great slimy python.  But next moment Harry had begun to spin very fast, and the Dursleys\\' living room was whipped out of sight in a rush of emerald-green flames.\\n',\n",

       " '\"Did he eat it?\" said Fred excitedly, holding out a hand to pull Harry to his fee\\n',\n",

       " '\"How\\'re you doing, Harry?\" said the nearer of the two, grinning at him and holding out a large hand, which Harry shook, feeling calluses and blisters under his fingers.  This had to be Charlie, who worked with dragons in Romania.  Charlie was built like the twins, shorter and stockier than Percy and Ron, who were both long and lanky.  He had a broad, good-natured face, which was weather-beaten and so freckly that he looked almost tanned; his arms were muscular, and one of them had a large, shiny burn on it.\\n',\n",
       " \"Bill got to his feet, smiling, and also shook Harry's hand.  Bill came as something of a surprise.  Harry knew that he worked for the wizarding bank, Gringotts, and that Bill had been Head Boy at Hogwarts; Harry had always imagined Bill to be an older version of Percy:  fussy about rule-breaking and fond of bossing everyone around.  However, Bill was - there was no other word for it - cool.  He was tall, with long hair that he had tied back in a ponytail.  He was wearing an earring with what looked like a fang dangling from it.  Bill's clothes would not have looked out of place at a rock concert, except that Harry recognized his boots to be made, not of leather, but of dragon hide.\\n\",\n",

One, with very bushy brown hair and rather large front teeth, was Harry's and Ron's friend, Hermione Granger.  The other, who was small and red-haired, was Ron's younger sister, Ginny.

       " '\"Oh hello, Harry,\" said Percy.  \"I was wondering who was making all the noise. I\\'m trying to work in here, you know I\\'ve got a report to finish for the office - and it\\'s rather difficult to concentrate when people keep thundering up and down the stairs.\"\\n',\n",
       " '\"We\\'re not thundering, \"said Ron irritably.  \"We\\'re walking.  Sorry if we\\'ve disturbed the top-secret workings of the Ministry of Magic.\"\\n',\n",
       " '\"What are you working on?\" said Harry.\\n',\n",
       " '\"A report for the Department of International Magical Cooperation,\" said Percy smugly. \"We\\'re trying to standardize cauldron thickness.  Some of these foreign imports are just a shade too thin - leakages have been increasing at a rate of almost three percent a year -\"\\n',\n",
       " '\"That\\'ll change the world, that report will,\" said Ron. \"Front page of the Daily Prophet, I expect, cauldron leaks.\"\\n',\n",
       " 'Percy went slightly pink.\\n',\n",
       " '\"You might sneer, Ron,\" he said heatedly, \"but unless some sort of international law is imposed we might well find the market flooded with flimsy, shallow-bottomed products that seriously endanger -\"\\n',\n",
       " '\"Yeah, yeah, all right,\" said Ron, and he started off upstairs again.  Percy slammed his bedroom door shut.  As Harry, Hermione, and Ginny followed Ron up three more flights of stairs, shouts from the kitchen below echoed up to them.  It sounded as though Mr. Weasley had told Mrs. Weasley about the toffees.\\n',\n",
       " \"The room at the top of the house where Ron slept looked much as it had the last time that Harry had come to stay: the same posters of Ron's favorite Quidditch team, the Chudley Cannons, were whirling and waving on the walls and sloping ceiling, and the fish tank on the windowsill, which had previously held frog spawn, now contained one extremely large frog. Ron's old rat, Scabbers, was here no more, but instead there was the tiny gray owl that had delivered Ron's letter to Harry in Privet Drive.  It was hopping up and down in a small cage and twittering madly.\\n\",\n",
       " '\"Shut up, Pig,\" said Ron, edging his way between two of the four beds that had been squeezed into the room.  \"Fred and George are in here with us, because Bill and Charlie are in their room,\" he told Harry.  \"Percy gets to keep his room all to himself because he\\'s got to work.\"\\n',\n",
       " '\"Er - why are you calling that owl Pig?\" Harry asked Ron.\\n',\n",
       " '\"Because he\\'s being stupid,\" said Ginny, \"Its proper name is Pigwidgeon.\"\\n',\n",
       " '\"Yeah, and that\\'s not a stupid name at all,\" said Ron sarcastically.  \"Ginny named him,\" he explained to Harry.  \"She reckons it\\'s sweet.  And I tried to change it, but it was too late, he won\\'t answer to anything else.  So now he\\'s Pig.  I\\'ve got to keep him up here because he annoys Errol and Hermes.  He annoys me too, come to that.\\n',\n",
       " \"Pigwidgeon zoomed happily around his cage, hooting shrilly.  Harry knew Ron too well to take him seriously.  He had moaned continually about his old rat, Scabbers, but had been most upset when Hermione's cat, Crookshanks, appeared to have eaten him.\\n\",\n",
       " '\"Where\\'s Crookshanks?\" Harry asked Hermione now.\\n',\n",
       " '\"Out in the garden, I expect,\" she said. \"He likes chasing gnomes.  He\\'s never seen any before.\"\\n',\n",
       " '\"Percy\\'s enjoying work, then?\"  said Harry, sitting down on one of the beds and watching the Chudley Cannons zooming in and out of the posters on the ceiling.\\n',\n",
       " '\"Enjoying it?\"  said Ron darkly.  \"I don\\'t reckon he\\'d come home if Dad didn\\'t make him.  He\\'s obsessed.  Just don\\'t get him onto the subject of his boss.  According to Mr. Crouch ... as I was saying to Mr. Crouch ... Mr. Crouch is of the opinion ... Mr. Crouch was telling me ... They\\'ll be announcing their engagement any day now.\"\\n',\n",
       " '\"Have you had a good summer, Harry?\"  said Hermione.  \"Did you get our food parcels and everything?\"\\n',\n",
       " '\"Yeah, thanks a lot, \" said Harry.  \"They saved my life, those cakes.\\n',\n",
       " '\"And have you heard from -?\"  Ron began, but at a look from Hermione he fell silent. Harry knew Ron had been about to ask about Sirius.  Ron and Hermione had been so deeply involved in helping Sirius escape from the Ministry of Magic that they were almost as concerned about Harry\\'s godfather as he was.  However, discussing him in front of Ginny was a bad idea. Nobody but themselves and Professor Dumbledore knew about how Sirius had escaped, or believed in his innocence.\\n',\n",
       " '\"I think they\\'ve stopped arguing,\" said Hermione, to cover the awkward moment, because Ginny was looking curiously from Ron to Harry.  \"Shall we go down and help your mum with dinner?\"\\n',\n",
       " '\"Yeah, all right,\" said Ron.  The four of them left Ron\\'s room and went back downstairs to find Mrs. Weasley alone in the kitchen, looking extremely bad-tempered.\\n',\n",
       " '\"We\\'re eating out in the garden,\" she said when they came in.  \"There\\'s just not room for eleven people in here.  Could you take the plates outside, girls?  Bill and Charlie are setting up the tables.  Knives and forks, please, you two,\" she said to Ron and Harry, pointing her wand a little more vigorously than she had intended at a pile of potatoes in the sink, which shot out of their skins so fast that they ricocheted off the walls and ceiling.\\n',\n",
       " '\"Oh for heaven\\'s sake,\" she snapped, now directing her wand at a dustpan, which hopped off the sideboard and started skating across the floor, scooping up the potatoes.  \"Those two!\" she burst out savagely, now pulling pots and pans out of a cupboard, and Harry knew she meant Fred and George.  I don\\'t know what\\'s going to happen to them, I really don\\'t. No ambition, unless you count making as much trouble as they possibly can....\"\\n',\n",
       " 'Mrs. Weasley slammed a large copper saucepan down on the kitchen table and began to wave her wand around inside it.  A creamy sauce poured from the wand tip as she stirred.\\n',\n",
       " '\"It\\'s not as though they haven\\'t got brains, she continued irritably, taking the saucepan over to the stove and lighting it with a further poke of her wand, \"but they\\'re wasting them, and unless they pull themselves together soon, they\\'ll be in real trouble.  I\\'ve had more owls from Hogwarts about them than the rest put together.  If they carry on the way they\\'re going, they\\'ll end up in front of the Improper Use of Magic Office.\"\\n',\n",
       " 'Mrs. Weasley jabbed her wand at the cutlery drawer, which shot open.  Harry and Ron both jumped out of the way as several knives soared out of it, flew across the kitchen, and began chopping the potatoes, which had just been tipped back into the sink by the dustpan.\\n',\n",
       " '\"I don\\'t know where we went wrong with them,\" said Mrs. Weasley, putting down her wand and starting to pull out still more saucepans.  \"It\\'s been the same for years, one thing after another, and they won\\'t listen to - OH NOT AGAIN!\"\\n',\n",
       " 'She had picked up her wand from the table, and it had emitted a loud squeak and turned into a giant rubber mouse.\\n',\n",
       " '\"One of their fake wands again!\" she shouted.  \"How many times have I told them not to leave them lying around?\"\\n',\n",
       " 'She grabbed her real wand and turned around to find that the sauce on the stove was smoking.\\n',\n",
       " '\"C\\'mon,\" Ron said hurriedly to Harry, seizing a handful of cutlery from the open drawer, \"let\\'s go and help Bill and Charlie.\"\\n',\n",
       " 'They left Mrs. Weasley and headed out the back door into the yard.\\n',\n",
       " \"They had only gone a few paces when Hermione's bandy-legged ginger cat, Crookshanks, came pelting out of the garden, bottle-brush tail held high in the air, chasing what looked like a muddy potato on legs.  Harry recognized it instantly as a gnome.  Barely ten inches high, its horny little feet pattered very fast as it sprinted across the yard and dived headlong into one of the Wellington boots that lay scattered around the door.  Harry could hear the gnome giggling madly as Crookshanks inserted a paw into the boot, trying to reach it. Meanwhile, a very loud crashing noise was coming from the other side of the house.  The source of the commotion was revealed as they entered the garden, and saw that Bill and Charlie both had their wands out, and were making two battered old tables fly high above the lawn, smashing into each other, each attempting to knock the other's out of the air.  Fred and George were cheering, Ginny was laughing, and Hermione was hovering near the hedge, apparently torn between amusement and anxiety.\\n\",\n",
       " \"Bill's table caught Charlie's with a huge bang and knocked one of its legs off.  There was a clatter from overhead, and they all looked up to see Percy's head poking out of a window on the second floor.\\n\",\n",
       " '\"Will you keep it down?!\" he bellowed.\\n',\n",
       " '\"Sorry, Perce,\" said Bill, grinning. \"How\\'re the cauldron bottoms coming on?\"\\n',\n",
       " '\"Very badly,\" said Percy peevishly, and he slammed the window shut.  Chuckling, Bill and Charlie directed the tables safely onto the grass, end to end, and then, with a flick of his wand, Bill reattached the table leg and conjured tablecloths from nowhere.\\n',\n",
       " \"By seven o'clock, the two tables were groaning under dishes and dishes of Mrs. Weasley's excellent cooking, and the nine Weasleys, Harry, and Hermione were settling themselves down to eat beneath a clear, deep-blue sky.  To somebody who had been living on meals of increasingly stale cake all summer, this was paradise, and at first, Harry listened rather than talked as he helped himself to chicken and ham pie, boiled potatoes, and salad.\\n\",\n",
       " 'At the far end of the table, Percy was telling his father all about his report on cauldron bottoms.\\n',\n",
       " '\"I\\'ve told Mr. Crouch that I\\'ll have it ready by Tuesday,\" Percy was saying pompously. \"That\\'s a bit sooner than he expected it, but I like to keep on top of things.  I think he\\'ll be grateful I\\'ve done it in good time, I mean, its extremely busy in our department just now, what with all the arrangements for the World Cup.  We\\'re just not getting the support we need from the Department of Magical Games and Sports.  Ludo Bagman -\"\\n',\n",
       " '\"I like Ludo,\" said Mr. Weasley mildly. \"He was the one who got us such good tickets for the Cup.  I did him a bit of a favor:  His brother, Otto, got into a spot of trouble - a lawnmower with unnatural powers - I smoothed the whole thing over.\"\\n',\n",
       " '\"Oh Bagman\\'s likable enough, of course,\" said Percy dismissively, \"but how he ever got to be Head of Department ... when I compare him to Mr. Crouch!  I can\\'t see Mr. Crouch losing a member of our department and not trying to find out what\\'s happened to them.  You realize Bertha Jorkins has been missing for over a month now?  Went on holiday to Albania and never came back?\"\\n',\n",
       " '\"Yes, I was asking Ludo about that,\" said Mr. Weasley, frowning.  \"He says Bertha\\'s gotten lost plenty of times before now - though must say, if it was someone in my department, I\\'d be worried. . . .\"\\n',\n",
       " '\"Oh Bertha\\'s hopeless, all right,\" said Percy.  \"I hear she\\'s been shunted from department to department for years, much more trouble than she\\'s worth ... but all the same, Bagman ought to be trying to find her.  Mr. Crouch has been taking a personal interest, she worked in our department at one time, you know, and I think Mr. Crouch was quite fond of her - but Bagman just keeps laughing and saying she probably misread the map and ended up in Australia instead of Albania.  However\" - Percy heaved an impressive sigh and took a deep swig of elderflower wine - \"we\\'ve got quite enough on our plates at the Department of International Magical Cooperation without trying to find members of other departments too.  As you know, we\\'ve got another big event to organize right after the World Cup.\"\\n',\n",

       " 'Harry had been on the Gryffindor House Quidditch team ever since his first year at Hogwarts and owned one of the best racing brooms in the world, a Firebolt.  Flying came more naturally to Harry than anything else in the magical world, and he played in the position of Seeker on the Gryffindor House team.\\n',\n",
       " 'Mr. Weasley conjured up candles to light the darkening garden before they had their homemade strawberry ice cream, and by the time they had finished, moths were fluttering low over the table, and the warm air was perfumed with the smells of grass and honeysuckle.

       " '\"Look at the time,\" Mrs. Weasley said suddenly, checking her wristwatch.  \"You really should be in bed, the whole lot of you you\\'ll be up at the crack of dawn to get to the Cup.

       " '\"Well, have a lovely time,\" said Mrs. Weasley, \"and behave yourselves,\" she called after the twins\\' retreating backs, but they did not look back or answer.  \"I\\'ll send Bill, Charlie, and Percy along around midday,\"  Mrs. Weasley said to Mr. Weasley, as he, Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Ginny set off across the dark yard after Fred and George.\\n',\n",
       " 'It was chilly and the moon was still out.  Only a dull, greenish tinge along the horizon to their right showed that daybreak was drawing closer.  Harry, having been thinking about thousands of wizards speeding toward the Quidditch World Cup, sped up to walk with Mr. Weasley.\\n',\n",
       " '\"So how does everyone get there without all the Muggles noticing?\" he asked.\\n',\n",
       " '\"It\\'s been a massive organizational problem,\" sighed Mr. Weasley.  \"The trouble is, about a hundred thousand wizards turn up at the World Cup, and of course, we just haven\\'t got a magical site big enough to accommodate them all.  There are places Muggles can\\'t penetrate, but imagine trying to pack a hundred thousand wizards into Diagon Alley or platform nine and three-quarters.  So we had to find a nice deserted moor, and set up as many anti-Muggle precautions as possible.  The whole Ministry\\'s been working on it for months.  First, of course, we have to stagger the arrivals.  People with cheaper tickets have to arrive two weeks beforehand.  A limited number use Muggle transport, but we can\\'t have too many clogging up their buses and trains - remember, wizards are coming from all over the world.  Some Apparate, of course, but we have to set up safe points for them to appear, well away from Muggles.  I believe there\\'s a handy wood they\\'re using as the Apparition point.  For those who don\\'t want to Apparate, or can\\'t, we use Portkeys.  They\\'re objects that are used to transport wizards from one spot to another at a prearranged time.  You can do large groups at a time if you need to.  There have been two hundred Portkeys placed at strategic points around Britain, and the nearest one to us is up at the top of Stoatshead Hill, so that\\'s where we\\'re headed.\"\\n',\n",
       " 'Mr. Weasley pointed ahead of them, where a large black mass rose beyond the village of Ottery St. Catchpole.\\n',\n",
       " '\"What sort of objects are Portkeys?\" said Harry curiously.\\n',\n",
       " '\"Well, they can be anything,\" said Mr. Weasley. \"Unobtrusive things, obviously, so Muggles don\\'t go picking them up and playing with them ... stuff they\\'ll just think is litter....\"\\n',\n",
       " \"They trudged down the dark, dank lane toward the village, the silence broken only by their footsteps.  The sky lightened very slowly as they made their way through the village, its inky blackness diluting to deepest blue.  Harry's hands and feet were freezing.  Mr. Weasley kept checking his watch.\\n\",\n",
       " \"They didn't have breath to spare for talking as they began to climb Stoatshead Hill, stumbling occasionally in hidden rabbit holes, slipping on thick black tuffets of grass.

       " 'Two tall figures were silhouetted against the starry sky on the other side of the hilltop.\\n',\n",

Quidditch World Cup, wouldn\\'t miss it for a sackful of Galleons - and the tickets cost about that. Mind you, looks like I got off easy. . . .\" Amos Diggory peered good-naturedly around at the three Weasley boys, Harry, Hermione, and Ginny.  \"All these yours, Arthur?\"\\n',\n",
       " '\"Oh no, only the redheads,\" said Mr. Weasley, pointing out his children.  \"This is Hermione, friend of Ron\\'s - and Harry, another friend -\"\\n',\n",

       " 'Harry was used to people looking curiously at him when they met him, used to the way their eyes moved at once to the lightning scar on his forehead, but it always made him feel uncomfortable.\\n',\n",
       " '\"Ced\\'s talked about you, of course,\" said Amos Diggory.  \"Told us all about playing against you last year... I said to him, I said - Ced, that\\'ll be something to tell your grandchildren, that will.... You beat Harry Potter!\"\\n',\n",
       " \"Harry couldn't think of any reply to this, so he remained silent. Fred and George were both scowling again.  Cedric looked slightly embarrassed.\\n\",\n",

       " '\"Yes, but you didn\\'t fall off, did you?\" roared Amos genially, slapping his son on his back. \"Always modest, our Ced, always the gentleman ... but the best man won, I\\'m sure Harry\\'d say the same, wouldn\\'t you, eh?  One falls off his broom, one stays on, you don\\'t need to be a genius to tell which one\\'s the better flier!\"\\n',\n",

       " 'They all stood there, in a tight circle, as a chill breeze swept over the hilltop.  Nobody spoke.  It suddenly occurred to Harry how odd this would look if a Muggle were to walk up here now ... nine people, two of them grown men, clutching this manky old boot in the semidarkness, waiting....\\n',\n",

His feet left the ground; he could feel Ron and Hermione on either side of him, their shoulders banging into his; they were all speeding forward in a howl of wind and swirling color; his forefinger was stuck to the boot as though it was pulling him magnetically onward and then -\\n',\n",
       " 'His feet slammed into the ground; Ron staggered into him and he fell over; the Portkey hit the ground near his head with a heavy thud.\\n',\n",

       " 'Harry disentangled himself from Ron and got to his feet.  They had arrived on what appeared to be a deserted stretch of misty moor.  In front of them was a pair of tired and grumpy-looking wizards, one of whom was holding a large gold watch, the other a thick roll of parchment and a quill.  Both were dressed as Muggles, though very inexpertly:  The man with the watch wore a tweed suit with thigh-length galoshes; his colleague, a kilt and a poncho.\\n',\n",
       " '\"Morning, Basil,\" said Mr. Weasley, picking up the boot and handing it to the kilted wizard, who threw it into a large box of used Portkeys beside him; Harry could see an old newspaper, an empty drinks can, and a punctured football.\\n',\n",
       " '\"Hello there, Arthur,\" said Basil wearily.  \"Not on duty, eh?  It\\'s all right for some.... We\\'ve been here all night.... You\\'d better get out of the way, we\\'ve got a big party coming in from the Black Forest at five fifteen.  Hang on, I\\'ll find your campsite.... Weasley ... Weasley....\" He consulted his parchment list.  \"About a quarter of a mile\\'s walk over there, first field you come to.  Site manager\\'s called Mr. Roberts.  Diggory ... second field ... ask for Mr. Payne.\"\\n',\n",
       " '\"Thanks, Basil,\" said Mr. Weasley, and he beckoned everyone to follow him.\\n',\n",
       " 'They set off across the deserted moor, unable to make out much through the mist.  After about twenty minutes, a small stone cottage next to a gate swam into view.  Beyond it, Harry could just make out the ghostly shapes of hundreds and hundreds of tents, rising up the gentle slope of a large field toward a dark wood on the horizon.  They said good-bye to the Diggorys and approached the cottage door.\\n',\n",
       " 'A man was standing in the doorway, looking out at the tents.  Harry knew at a glance that this was the only real Muggle for several acres.  When he heard their footsteps, he turned his head to look at them.\\n',\n",
       " '\"Morning!\" said Mr. Weasley brightly.\\n',\n",
       " '\"Morning,\" said the Muggle.\\n',\n",
       " '\"Would you be Mr. Roberts?\"\\n',\n",
       " '\"Aye, I would,\" said Mr. Roberts. \"And who\\'re you?\"\\n',\n",
       " '\"Weasley - two tents, booked a couple of days ago?\"\\n',\n",
       " '\"Aye,\" said Mr. Roberts, consulting a list tacked to the door.  \"You\\'ve got a space up by the wood there.  Just the one night?\"\\n',\n",
       " '\"That\\'s it,\" said Mr. Weasley.\\n',\n",
       " '\"You\\'ll be paying now, then?\" said Mr. Roberts.\\n',\n",
       " '\"Ah - right - certainly -\" said Mr. Weasley.  He retreated a short distance from the cottage and beckoned Harry toward him.  \"Help me, Harry,\" he muttered, pulling a roll of Muggle money from his pocket and starting to peel the notes apart.  \"This one\\'s a - a - a ten?  Ah yes, I see the little number on it now... So this is a five?\"\\n',\n",
       " '\"A twenty,\" Harry corrected him in an undertone, uncomfortably aware of Mr. Roberts trying to catch every word.\\n',\n",
       " '\"Ah yes, so it is.... I don\\'t know, these little bits of paper...\"\\n',\n",
       " '\"You foreign?\" said Mr. Roberts as Mr. Weasley returned with the correct notes.\\n',\n",
       " '\"Foreign?\" repeated Mr. Weasley, puzzled.\\n',\n",
       " '\"You\\'re not the first one who\\'s had trouble with money,\" said Mr. Roberts, scrutinizing Mr. Weasley closely. \"I had two try and pay me with great gold coins the size of hubcaps ten minutes ago.\"\\n',\n",
       " '\"Did you really?\" said Mr. Weasley nervously.\\n',\n",
       " 'Mr. Roberts rummaged around in a tin for some change.\\n',\n",
       " '\"Never been this crowded,\" he said suddenly, looking out over the misty field again. \"Hundreds of pre-bookings.  People usually just turn up....\"\\n',\n",
       " '\"Is that right?\" said Mr. Weasley, his hand held out for his change, but Mr. Roberts didn\\'t give it to him.\\n',\n",
       " '\"Aye,\" he said thoughtfully. \"People from all over.  Loads of foreigners.  And not just foreigners.  Weirdos, you know?  There\\'s a bloke walking \\'round in a kilt and a poncho.\"\\n',\n",
       " '\"Shouldn\\'t he?\"  said Mr. Weasley anxiously\\n',\n",
       " '\"It\\'s like some sort of... I dunno ... like some sort of rally,\" said Mr. Roberts.  \"They all seem to know each other.  Like a big party.\"\\n',\n",
       " \"At that moment, a wizard in plus-fours appeared out of thin air next to Mr. Roberts's front door.\\n\",\n",
       " '\"Obliviate!\" he said sharply, pointing his wand at Mr. Roberts.\\n',\n",
       " \"Instantly, Mr. Roberts's eyes slid out of focus, his brows unknitted, and a took of dreamy unconcern fell over his face.  Harry recognized the symptoms of one who had just had his memory modified.\\n\",\n",
       " '\"A map of the campsite for you,\" Mr. Roberts said placidly to Mr. Weasley.  \"And your change.\"\\n',\n",
       " '\"Thanks very much,\" said Mr. Weasley.\\n',\n",
       " 'The wizard in plus-fours accompanied them toward the gate to the campsite.  He looked exhausted:  His chin was blue with stubble and there were deep purple shadows under his eyes.  Once out of earshot of Mr. Roberts, he muttered to Mr. Weasley, \"Been having a lot of trouble with him.  Needs a Memory Charm ten times a day to keep him happy.  And Ludo Bagman\\'s not helping.  Trotting around talking about Bludgers and Quaffles at the top of his voice, not a worry about anti-Muggle security Blimey, I\\'ll be glad when this is over.  See you later, Arthur.\"\\n',\n",
       " 'He Disapparated.\\n',\n",
       " '\"I thought Mr. Bagman was Head of Magical Games and Sports,\" said Ginny, looking surprised.  \"He should know better than to talk about Bludgers near Muggles, shouldn\\'t he?\"\\n',\n",
       " '\"He should,\" said Mr. Weasley, smiling, and leading them through the gates into the campsite, \"but Ludo\\'s always been a bit ... well . . . lax about security.  You couldn\\'t wish for a more enthusiastic head of the sports department though.  He played Quidditch for England himself, you know.  And he was the best Beater the Wimbourne Wasps ever had.\"\\n',\n",
       " 'They trudged up the misty field between long rows of tents.  Most looked almost ordinary; their owners had clearly tried to make them as Muggle-like as possible, but had slipped up by adding chimneys, or bellpulls, or weather vanes.  However, here and there was a tent so obviously magical that Harry could hardly be surprised that Mr. Roberts was getting suspicious.  Halfway up the field stood an extravagant confection of striped silk like a miniature palace, with several live peacocks tethered at the entrance.  A little farther on they passed a tent that had three floors and several turrets; and a short way beyond that was a tent that had a front garden attached, complete with birdbath, sundial, and fountain.\\n',\n",
       " '\"Always the same,\" said Mr. Weasley, smiling.  \"We can\\'t resist showing off when we get together.  Ah, here we are, look, this is us.\"\\n',\n",
       " 'They had reached the very edge of the wood at the top of the field, and here was an empty space, with a small sign hammered into the ground that read WEEZLY.\\n',\n",
       " '\"Couldn\\'t have a better spot!\" said Mr. Weasley happily.  \"The field is just on the other side of the wood there, we\\'re as close as we could be.\"  He hoisted his backpack from his shoulders.  \"Right,\" he said excitedly, \"no magic allowed, strictly speaking, not when we\\'re out in these numbers on Muggle land.  We\\'ll be putting these tents up by hand!  Shouldn\\'t be too difficult.... Muggles do it all the time.... Here, Harry, where do you reckon we should start?\"\\n',\n",
       " 'Harry had never been camping in his life; the Dursleys had never taken him on any kind of holiday, preferring to leave him with Mrs. Figg, an old neighbor.  However, he and Hermione worked out where most of the poles and pegs should go, and though Mr. Weasley was more of a hindrance than a help, because he got thoroughly overexcited when it came to using the mallet, they finally managed to erect a pair of shabby two-man tents.\\n',\n",
       " 'All of them stood back to admire their handiwork.  Nobody looking at these tents would guess they belonged to wizards, Harry thought, but the trouble was that once Bill, Charlie, and Percy arrived, they would be a party of ten. Hermione seemed to have spotted this problem too; she gave Harry a quizzical look as Mr. Weasley dropped to his hands and knees and entered the first tent.\\n',\n",
       " '\"We\\'ll be a bit cramped,\" he called, \"but I think we\\'ll all squeeze in. Come and have a look.\"\\n',\n",
       " \"Harry bent down, ducked under the tent flap, and felt his jaw drop.  He had walked into what looked like an old-fashioned, three room flat, complete with bathroom and kitchen. Oddly enough, it was furnished in exactly the same sort of style as Mrs. Figg's house:  There were crocheted covers on the mismatched chairs and a strong smell of cats.\\n\",\n",
       " '\"Well, it\\'s not for long,\" said Mr. Weasley, mopping his bald patch with a handkerchief and peering in at the four bunk beds that stood in the bedroom.  I borrowed this from Perkins at the office.  Doesn\\'t camp much anymore, poor fellow, he\\'s got lumbago.\"\\n',\n",
       " 'He picked up the dusty kettle and peered inside it.  \"We\\'ll need water....\\n',\n",
       " '\"There\\'s a tap marked on this map the Muggle gave us,\" said Ron, who had followed Harry inside the tent and seemed completely unimpressed by its extraordinary inner proportions. \"It\\'s on the other side of the field.\"\\n',\n",
       " '\"Well, why don\\'t you, Harry, and Hermione go and get us some water then\" - Mr. Weasley handed over the kettle and a couple of saucepans - \"and the rest of us will get some wood for a fire?\"\\n',\n",
       " '\"But we\\'ve got an oven,\" said Ron.  \"Why can\\'t we just -\"\\n',\n",
       " '\"Ron, anti-Muggle security!\"  said Mr. Weasley, his face shining with anticipation. \"When real Muggles camp, they cook on fires outdoors.  I\\'ve seen them at it!\"\\n',\n",
       " \"After a quick tour of the girls' tent, which was slightly smaller than the boys', though without the smell of cats, Harry, Ron, and Hermione set off across the campsite with the kettle and saucepans.\\n\",\n",
       " 'Now, with the sun newly risen and the mist lifting, they could see the city of tents that stretched in every direction.  They made their way slowly through the rows, staring eagerly around.  It was only just dawning on Harry how many witches and wizards there must be in the world; he had never really thought much about those in other countries.\\n',\n",
       " 'Their fellow campers were starting to wake up.  First to stir were the families with small children; Harry had never seen witches and wizards this young before.  A tiny boy no older than two was crouched outside a large pyramid-shaped tent, holding a wand and poking happily at a slug in the grass, which was swelling slowly to the size of a salami.  As they drew level with him, his mother came hurrying out of the tent.\\n',\n",
       " '\"How many times, Kevin?  You don\\'t - touch - Daddy\\'s - wand - yecchh! \"\\n',\n",
       " 'She had trodden on the giant slug, which burst.  Her scolding carried after them on the still air, mingling with the little boy\\'s yells - \"You bust slug!  You bust slug!\"\\n',\n",
       " 'A short way farther on, they saw two little witches, barely older than Kevin, who were riding toy broomsticks that rose only high enough for the girls\\' toes to skim the dewy grass.  A Ministry wizard had already spotted them; as he hurried past Harry, Ron, and Hermione he muttered distractedly, \"In broad daylight!  Parents having a lie-in, I suppose -\"\\n',\n",
       " \"Here and there adult wizards and witches were emerging from their tents and starting to cook breakfast.  Some, with furtive looks around them, conjured fires with their wands; others were striking matches with dubious looks on their faces, as though sure this couldn't work. Three African wizards sat in serious conversation, all of them wearing long white robes and roasting what looked like a rabbit on a bright purple fire, while a group of middle-aged American witches sat gossiping happily beneath a spangled banner stretched between their tents that read:  THE SALEM WITCHES' INSTITUTE.  Harry caught snatches of conversation in strange languages from the inside of tents they passed, and though he couldn't understand a word, the tone of every single voice was excited.\\n\",\n",
       " '\"Er - is it my eyes, or has everything gone green?\" said Ron.\\n',\n",
       " \"It wasn't just Ron's eyes. They had walked into a patch of tents that were all covered with a thick growth of shamrocks, so that it looked as though small, oddly shaped hillocks had sprouted out of the earth.  Grinning faces could be seen under those that had their flaps open. Then, from behind them, they heard their names.\\n\",\n",
       " '\"Harry!  Ron!  Hermione!\"\\n',\n",
       " 'It was Seamus Finnigan, their fellow Gryffindor fourth year.  He was sitting in front of his own shamrock-covered tent, with a sandy-haired woman who had to be his mother, and his best friend, Dean Thomas, also of Gryffindor.\\n',\n",
       " '\"Like the decorations?\" said Seamus, grinning.  \"The Ministry\\'s not too happy.\"\\n',\n",
       " '\"Ah, why shouldn\\'t we show our colors?\"  said Mrs. Finnigan.  \"You should see what the Bulgarians have got dangling all over their tents.  You\\'ll be supporting Ireland, of course?\" she added, eyeing Harry, Ron, and Hermione beadily.  When they had assured her that they were indeed supporting Ireland, they set off again, though, as Ron said, \"Like we\\'d say anything else surrounded by that lot.\" I wonder what the Bulgarians have got dangling all over their tents?\"  said Hermione.\\n',\n",
       " '\"Let\\'s go and have a look,\" said Harry, pointing to a large patch of tents upfield, where the Bulgarian flag - white, green, and red - was fluttering in the breeze.\\n',\n",
       " 'The tents here had not been bedecked with plant life, but each and every one of them had the same poster attached to it, a poster of a very surly face with heavy black eyebrows. The picture was, of course, moving, but all it did was blink and scowl.\\n',\n",
       " '\"Krum,\" said Ron quietly.\\n',\n",
       " '\"What?\" said Hermione.\\n',\n",
       " '\"Krum!\" said Ron. \"Viktor Krum, the Bulgarian Seeker!\"\\n',\n",
       " '\"He looks really grumpy,\" said Hermione, looking around at the many Krums blinking and scowling at them.\\n',\n",
       " '\"\\'Really grumpy?\"  Ron raised his eyes to the heavens.  \"Who cares what he looks like? He\\'s unbelievable.  He\\'s really young too.  Only just eighteen or something.  He\\'s a genius, you wait until tonight, you\\'ll see.\"\\n',\n",
       " 'There was already a small queue for the tap in the corner of the field.  Harry, Ron, and Hermione joined it, right behind a pair of men who were having a heated argument.  One of them was a very old wizard who was wearing a long flowery nightgown.  The other was clearly a Ministry wizard; he was holding out a pair of pinstriped trousers and almost crying with exasperation.\\n',\n",
       " '\"Just put them on, Archie, there\\'s a good chap.  You can\\'t walk around like that, the Muggle at the gate\\'s already getting suspicious -\\n',\n",
       " 'I bought this in a Muggle shop,\" said the old wizard stubbornly.  \"Muggles wear them.\"\\n',\n",
       " '\"Muggle women wear them, Archie, not the men, they wear these,\" said the Ministry wizard, and he brandished the pinstriped trousers.\\n',\n",
       " '\"I\\'m not putting them on,\" said old Archie in indignation.  \"I like a healthy breeze \\'round my privates, thanks.\"\\n',\n",
       " 'Hermione was overcome with such a strong fit of the giggles at this point that she had to duck out of the queue and only returned when Archie had collected his water and moved away.\\n',\n",
       " \"Walking more slowly now, because of the weight of the water, they made their way back through the campsite.  Here and there, they saw more familiar faces:  other Hogwarts students with their families.  Oliver Wood, the old captain of Harry's House Quidditch team, who had just left Hogwarts, dragged Harry over to his parents' tent to introduce him, and told him excitedly that he had just been signed to the Puddlemere United reserve team.  Next they were hailed by Ernie Macmillan, a Hufflepuff fourth year, and a little farther on they saw Cho Chang, a very pretty girl who played Seeker on the Ravenclaw team.  She waved and smiled at Harry, who slopped quite a lot of water down his front as he waved back.  More to stop Ron from smirking than anything, Harry hurriedly pointed out a large group of teenagers whom he had never seen before.\\n\",\n",
       " '\"Who d\\'you reckon they are?\" he said.  \"They don\\'t go to Hogwarts, do they?\"\\n',\n",
       " '\"\\'Spect they go to some foreign school,\" said Ron.  \"I know there are others.  Never met anyone who went to one, though. Bill had a penfriend at a school in Brazil ... this was years and years ago ... and he wanted to go on an exchange trip but Mum and Dad couldn\\'t afford it. His penfriend got all offended when he said he wasn\\'t going and sent him a cursed hat. It made his ears shrivel up.\"\\n',\n",
       " \"Harry laughed but didn't voice the amazement he felt at hearing about other wizarding schools.  He supposed, now that he saw representatives of so many nationalities in the campsite, that he had been stupid never to realize that Hogwarts couldn't be the only one.  He glanced at Hermione, who looked utterly unsurprised by the information.  No doubt she had run across the news about other wizarding schools in some book or other.\\n\",\n",
       " '\"You\\'ve been ages,\" said George when they finally got back to the Weasleys\\' tents.\\n',\n",

       " '\"Come here, Mr. Weasley,\" said Hermione kindly, taking the box from him, and showing him how to do it properly.\\n',\n",
       " \"At last they got the fire lit, though it was at least another hour before it was hot enough to cook anything.  There was plenty to watch while they waited, however.  Their tent seemed to be pitched right alongside a kind of thoroughfare to the field, and Ministry members kept hurrying up and down it, greeting Mr. Weasley cordially as they passed.  Mr. Weasley kept up a running commentary, mainly for Harry's and Hermione's benefit; his own children knew too much about the Ministry to be greatly interested.\\n\",\n",

He was wearing long Quidditch robes in thick horizontal stripes of bright yellow and black.  An enormous picture of a wasp was splashed across his chest.  He had the look of a powerfully built man gone slightly to seed; the robes were stretched tightly across a large belly he surely had not had in the days when he had played Quidditch for England.  His nose was squashed (probably broken by a stray Bludger, Harry thought), but his round blue eyes, short blond hair, and rosy complexion made him look like a very overgrown schoolboy.\\n',\n",

The parting in his short gray hair was almost unnaturally straight, and his narrow toothbrush mustache looked as though he trimmed it using a slide rule.  His shoes were very highly polished.  Harry could see at once why Percy idolized him.

       " 'Salesmen were Apparating every few feet, carrying trays and pushing carts full of extraordinary merchandise.

The atmosphere of feverish excitement was highly infectious; Harry couldn't stop grinning.  They walked through the wood for twenty minutes, talking and joking loudly, until at last they emerged on the other side and found themselves in the shadow of a gigantic stadium.  Though Harry could see only a fraction of the immense gold walls surrounding the field, he could tell that ten cathedrals would fit comfortably inside it.\\n\",\n",

Mr. Weasley's party kept climbing, and at last they reached the top of the staircase and found themselves in a small box, set at the highest point of the stadium and situated exactly halfway between the golden goal posts.  About twenty purple-and-gilt chairs stood in two rows here, and Harry, filing into the front seats with the Weasleys, looked down upon a scene the likes of which he could never have imagined.\\n\",\n",
       " \"A hundred thousand witches and wizards were taking their places in the seats, which rose in levels around the long oval field.  Everything was suffused with a mysterious golden light, which seemed to come from the stadium itself.  The field looked smooth as velvet from their lofty position.  At either end of the field stood three goal hoops, fifty feet high; right opposite them, almost at Harry's eye level, was a gigantic blackboard.  Gold writing kept dashing across it as though an invisible giant's hand were scrawling upon the blackboard and then wiping it off again; watching it, Harry saw that it was flashing advertisements across the field.\\n\",\n",

       " '\"Did sir just call me Dobby?\"  squeaked the elf curiously from between its fingers.  Its voice was higher even than Dobby\\'s had been, a teeny, quivering squeak of a voice, and Harry suspected though it was very hard to tell with a house-elf - that this one might just be female. Ron and Hermione spun around in their seats to look.  Though they had heard a lot about Dobby from Harry, they had never actually met him.  Even Mr. Weasley looked around in interest.\\n',\n",

       " \"And as the veela danced faster and faster, wild, half-formed thoughts started chasing through Harry's dazed mind.  He wanted to do something very impressive, right now.  Jumping from the box into the stadium seemed a good idea. . . but would it be good enough?\\n\",\n",
       " '\"Harry, what are you doing?\" said Hermione\\'s voice from a long way off.\\n',\n",
       " 'The music stopped.  Harry blinked. He was standing up, and one of his legs was resting on the wall of the box.  Next to him, Ron was frozen in an attitude that looked as though he were about to dive from a springboard.\\n',\n",
       " \"Angry yells were filling the stadium. The crowd didn't want the veela to go. Harry was with them; he would, of course, be supporting Bulgaria, and he wondered vaguely why he had a large green shamrock pinned to his chest.  Ron, meanwhile, was absentmindedly shredding the shamrocks on his hat.  Mr. Weasley, smiling slightly, leaned over to Ron and tugged the hat out of his hands.\\n\",\n",
       " '\"You\\'ll be wanting that,\" he said, \"once Ireland have had their say.\"\\n',\n",

       " 'Next moment, what seemed to be a great green-and-gold comet came zooming into the stadium.  It did one circuit of the stadium, then split into two smaller comets, each hurtling toward the goal posts.  A rainbow arced suddenly across the field, connecting the two balls of light.  The crowd oooohed and aaaaahed, as though at a fireworks display.  Now the rainbow faded and the balls of light reunited and merged; they had formed a great shimmering shamrock, which rose up into the sky and began to soar over the stands.  Something like golden rain seemed to be falling from it - \"Excellent!\"  yelled Ron as the shamrock soared over them, and heavy gold coins rained from it, bouncing off their heads and seats.  Squinting up at the shamrock, Harry realized that it was actually comprised of thousands of tiny little bearded men with red vests, each carrying a minute lamp of gold or green.\\n',\n",
       " '\"Leprechauns!\" said Mr. Weasley over the tumultuous applause of the crowd, many of whom were still fighting and rummaging around under their chairs to retrieve the gold.\\n',\n",

       " 'The great shamrock dissolved, the leprechauns drifted down onto the field on the opposite side from the veela, and settled themselves cross-legged to watch the match.\\n',\n",
       " '\"And now, ladies and gentlemen, kindly welcome - the Bulgarian National Quidditch Team!  I give you - Dimitrov!\"\\n',\n",
       " 'A scarlet-clad figure on a broomstick, moving so fast it was blurred, shot out onto the field from an entrance far below, to wild applause from the Bulgarian supporters.\\n',\n",

Harry spun the speed dial on his Omnioculars back to normal, watching closely as Mostafa mounted his broomstick and kicked the crate open - four balls burst into the air: the scarlet Quaffle, the two black Bludgers, and (Harry saw it for the briefest moment, before it sped out of sight) the minuscule, winged Golden Snitch.  With a sharp blast on his whistle, Mostafa shot into the air after the balls.\\n\",\n",
       " '\"Theeeeeeeey\\'re OFF!\"  screamed Bagman. \"And it\\'s Mullet! Troy! Moran! Dimitrov! Back to Mullet! Troy! Levski! Moran!\"\\n',\n",
       " 'It was Quidditch as Harry had never seen it played before. He was pressing his Omnioculars so hard to his glasses that they were cutting into the bridge of his nose. The speed of the players was incredible - the Chasers were throwing the Quaffle to one another so fast that Bagman only had time to say their names.  Harry spun the slow dial on the right of his Omnioculars again, pressed the play-by-play button on the top, and he was immediately watching in slow motion, while glittering purple lettering flashed across the lenses and the noise of the crowd pounded against his eardrums.\\n',\n",
       " 'HAWKSHEAD ATTACKING FORMATION, he read as he watched the three Irish Chasers zoom closely together, Troy in the center, slightly ahead of Mullet and Moran, bearing down upon the Bulgarians.  PORSKOFF PLOY flashed up next, as Troy made as though to dart upward with the Quaffle, drawing away the Bulgarian Chaser Ivanova and dropping the Quaffle to Moran.  One of the Bulgarian Beaters, Volkov, swung hard at a passing Bludger with his small club, knocking it into Moran\\'s path; Moran ducked to avoid the Bludger and dropped the Quaffle; and Levski, soaring beneath, caught it - \"TROY SCORES!\" roared Bagman, and the stadium shuddered with a roar of applause and cheers. \"Ten zero to Ireland!\"\\n',\n",
       " '\"What?\"  Harry yelled, looking wildly around through his Omnioculars. \"But Levski\\'s got the Quaffle!\"\\n',\n",
       " '\"Harry, if you\\'re not going to watch at normal speed, you\\'re going to miss things!\" shouted Hermione, who was dancing up and down, waving her arms in the air while Troy did a lap of honor around the field. Harry looked quickly over the top of his Omnioculars and saw that the leprechauns watching from the sidelines had all risen into the air again and formed the great, glittering shamrock. Across the field, the veela were watching them sulkily.\\n',\n",

       " \"The match became still faster, but more brutal. Volkov and Vulchanov, the Bulgarian Beaters, were whacking the Bludgers as fiercely as possible at the Irish Chasers, and were starting to prevent them from using some of their best moves; twice they were forced to scatter, and then, finally, Ivanova managed to break through their ranks; dodge the Keeper, Ryan; and score Bulgaria's first goal.\\n\",\n",
       " '\"Fingers in your ears!\" bellowed Mr. Weasley as the veela started to dance in celebration. Harry screwed up his eyes too; he wanted to keep his mind on the game. After a few seconds, he chanced a glance at the field.  The veela had stopped dancing, and Bulgaria was again in possession of the Quaffle.\\n',\n",

He saw Krum's face contorted with concentration as he pulled out of the dive just in time, while Lynch was flattened, and he understood - Krum hadn't seen the Snitch at all, he was just making Lynch copy him.  Harry had never seen anyone fly like that; Krum hardly looked as though he was using a broomstick at all; he moved so easily through the air that he looked unsupported and weightless.  Harry turned his Omnioculars back to normal and focused them on Krum.  He was now circling high above Lynch, who was being revived by mediwizards with cups of potion.  Harry, focusing still more closely upon Krum's face, saw his dark eyes darting all over the ground a hundred feet below.  He was using the time while Lynch was revived to look for the Snitch without interference.\\n\",\n",
       " 'Lynch got to his feet at last, to loud cheers from the green-clad supporters, mounted his Firebolt, and kicked back off into the air.  His revival seemed to give Ireland new heart.

       " 'A mediwizard came tearing across the field, his fingers stuffed into his own ears, and kicked Mostafa hard in the shins. Mostafa seemed to come to himself; Harry, watching through the Omnioculars again, saw that he looked exceptionally embarrassed and had started shouting at the veela, who had stopped dancing and were looking mutinous.\\n',\n",

       " '\"Two penalties for Ireland!\" shouted Bagman, and the Bulgarian crowd howled with anger.  \"And Volkov and Vulchanov had better get back on those brooms. . . yes. . . there they go. . . and Troy takes the Quaffle. .\\n',\n",
       " 'Play now reached a level of ferocity beyond anything they had yet seen. The Beaters on both sides were acting without mercy:  Volkov and Vulchanov in particular seemed not to care whether their clubs made contact with Bludger or human as they swung them violently through the air.

At this, the veela lost control.  Instead of dancing, they launched themselves across the field and began throwing what seemed to be handfuls of fire at the leprechauns.  Watching through his Omnioculars, Harry saw that they didn't look remotely beautiful now.  On the contrary, their faces were elongating into sharp, cruel-beaked bird heads, and long, scaly wings were bursting from their shoulders -\\n\",\n",

He looked surlier than ever and refused to let them mop him up.  His team members were around him, shaking their heads and looking dejected; a short way away, the Irish players were dancing gleefully in a shower of gold descending from their mascots.  Flags were waving all over the stadium, the Irish national anthem blared from all sides; the veela were shrinking back into their usual, beautiful selves now, though looking dispirited and forlorn.\\n',\n",

Krum, who was last in line, looked a real mess.  Two black eyes were blooming spectacularly on his bloody face.  He was still holding the Snitch.  Harry noticed that he seemed much less coordinated on the ground.  He was slightly duck-footed and distinctly round-shouldered.

Raucous singing was borne toward them on the night air as they retraced their steps along the lantern-lit path, and leprechauns kept shooting over their heads, cackling and waving their lanterns.  When they finally reached the tents, nobody felt like sleeping at all, and given the level of noise around them, Mr. Weasley agreed that they could all have one last cup of cocoa together before turning in.  They were soon arguing enjoyably about the match; Mr. Weasley got drawn into a disagreement about cobbing with Charlie, and it was only when Ginny fell asleep right at the tiny table and spilled hot chocolate all over the floor that Mr. Weasley called a halt to the verbal replays and insisted that everyone go to bed.  Hermione and Ginny went into the next tent, and Harry and the rest of the Weasleys changed into pajamas and clambered into their bunks.

       " \"A crowd of wizards, tightly packed and moving together with wands pointing straight upward, was marching slowly across the field. Harry squinted at them. . . . They didn't seem to have faces. . . . Then he realized that their heads were hooded and their faces masked.  High above them, floating along in midair, four struggling figures were being contorted into grotesque shapes.  It was as though the masked wizards on the ground were puppeteers, and the people above them were marionettes operated by invisible strings that rose from the wands into the air. Two of the figures were very small.\\n\",\n",

       " \"Hermione and Ginny came hurrying toward them, pulling coats over their nightdresses, with Mr. Weasley right behind them.  At the same moment, Bill, Charlie, and Percy emerged from the boys' tent, fully dressed, with their sleeves rolled up and their wands out.\\n\",\n",
       " '\"We\\'re going to help the Ministry!\"  Mr. Weasley shouted over all the noise, rolling up his own sleeves.  \"You lot - get into the woods, and stick together.  I\\'ll come and fetch you when we\\'ve sorted this out!\"\\n',\n",
       " 'Bill, Charlie, and Percy were already sprinting away toward the oncoming marchers; Mr. Weasley tore after them. Ministry wizards were dashing from every direction toward the source of the trouble.  The crowd beneath the Roberts family was coming ever closer.\\n',\n",
       " '\"C\\'mon,\" said Fred, grabbing Ginny\\'s hand and starting to pull her toward the wood. Harry, Ron, Hermione, and George followed. They all looked back as they reached the trees. The crowd beneath the Roberts family was larger than ever; they could see the Ministry wizards trying to get through it to the hooded wizards in the center, but they were having great difficulty. It looked as though they were scared to perform any spell that might make the Roberts family fall.\\n',\n",
       " 'The colored lanterns that had lit the path to the stadium had been extinguished.  Dark figures were blundering through the trees; children were crying; anxious shouts and panicked voices were reverberating around them in the cold night air.  Harry felt himself being pushed hither and thither by people whose faces he could not see.  Then he heard Ron yell with pain.\\n',\n",
       " '\"What happened?\"  said Hermione anxiously, stopping so abruptly that Harry walked into her.  \"Ron, where are you? Oh this is stupid - lumos!\"\\n',\n",
       " 'She illuminated her wand and directed its narrow beam across the path. Ron was lying sprawled on the ground.\\n',\n",
       " '\"Tripped over a tree root,\" he said angrily, getting to his feet again.\\n',\n",
       " '\"Well, with feet that size, hard not to,\" said a drawling voice from behind them.\\n',\n",
       " 'Harry, Ron, and Hermione turned sharply. Draco Malfoy was standing alone nearby, leaning against a tree, looking utterly relaxed.  His arms folded, he seemed to have been watching the scene at the campsite through a gap in the trees.\\n',\n",
       " 'Ron told Malfoy to do something that Harry knew he would never have dared say in front of Mrs. Weasley.\\n',\n",
       " '\"Language, Weasley,\" said Malfoy, his pale eyes glittering.  \"Hadn\\'t you better be hurrying along, now?  You wouldn\\'t like her spotted, would you?\"\\n',\n",
       " 'He nodded at Hermione, and at the same moment, a blast like a bomb sounded from the campsite, and a flash of green light momentarily lit the trees around them.\\n',\n",
       " '\"What\\'s that supposed to mean?\" said Hermione defiantly.  \"Granger, they\\'re after Muggles, \"said Malfoy.  \"D\\'you want to be showing off your knickers in midair?  Because if you do, hang around. . . they\\'re moving this way, and it would give us all a laugh.\"\\n',\n",
       " '\"Hermione\\'s a witch,\" Harry snarled.\\n',\n",
       " '\"Have it your own way, Potter,\" said Malfoy, grinning maliciously. \"If you think they can\\'t spot a Mudblood, stay where you are.\"\\n',\n",
       " '\"You watch your mouth!\" shouted Ron. Everybody present knew that \"Mudblood\" was a very offensive term for a witch or wizard of Muggle parentage.\\n',\n",
       " '\"Never mind, Ron,\" said Hermione quickly, seizing Ron\\'s arm to restrain him as he took a step toward Malfoy.\\n',\n",
       " 'There came a bang from the other side of the trees that was louder than anything they had heard. Several people nearby screamed. Malfoy chuckled softly.\\n',\n",
       " '\"Scare easily, don\\'t they?\" he said lazily. \"I suppose your daddy told you all to hide? What\\'s he up to - trying to rescue the Muggles?\"\\n',\n",
       " '\"Where\\'re your parents?\" said Harry, his temper rising. \"Out there wearing masks, are they?\"\\n',\n",
       " 'Malfoy turned his face to Harry, still smiling.\\n',\n",
       " '\"Well. . . if they were, I wouldn\\'t be likely to tell you, would I, Potter?\"\\n',\n",
       " '\"Oh come on,\" said Hermione, with a disgusted look at Malfoy, \"let\\'s go and find the others.\"\\n',\n",
       " ' \"Keep that big bushy head down, Granger,\" sneered Malfoy.\\n',\n",
       " '\"Come on,\" Hermione repeated, and she pulled Harry and Ron up the path again.\\n',\n",
       " '\"I\\'ll bet you anything his dad is one of that masked lot!\" said Ron hotly.\\n',\n",
       " '\"Well, with any luck, the Ministry will catch him!\" said Hermione fervently. \"Oh I can\\'t believe this. Where have the others got to?\"\\n',\n",
       " 'Fred, George, and Ginny were nowhere to be seen, though the path was packed with plenty of other people, all looking nervously over their shoulders toward the commotion back at the campsite.  A huddle of teenagers in pajamas was arguing vociferously a little way along the path.  When they saw Harry, Ron, and Hermione, a girl with thick curly hair turned and said quickly, \"O\\\\FC est Madame Maxime? Nous l\\'avons perdue -\"\\n',\n",
       " '\"Er - what?\" said Ron.\\n',\n",
       " '\"Oh. . .\" The girl who had spoken turned her back on him, and as they walked on they distinctly heard her say, \"Ogwarts.\"\\n',\n",
       " '\"Beauxbatons,\" muttered Hermione.\\n',\n",
       " '\"Sorry?\" said Harry.\\n',\n",
       " '\"They must go to Beauxbatons,\" said Hermione.  \"You know... Beauxbatons Academy of Magic. . . I read about it in An Appraisal ofMagical Education in Europe.\"\\n',\n",
       " '\"Oh. . . yeah. . . right,\" said Harry.\\n',\n",
       " '\"Fred and George can\\'t have gone that far,\" said Ron, pulling out his wand, lighting it like Hermione\\'s, and squinting up the path. Harry dug in the pockets of his jacket for his own wand - but it wasn\\'t there.  The only thing he could find was his Omnioculars.\\n',\n",
       " '\"Ah, no, I don\\'t believe it. . . I\\'ve lost my wand!\"\\n',\n",
       " ' \"You\\'re kidding!\"\\n',\n",
       " 'Ron and Hermione raised their wands high enough to spread the narrow beams of light farther on the ground; Harry looked all around him, but his wand was nowhere to be seen.\\n',\n",
       " '\"Maybe it\\'s back in the tent,\" said Ron.\\n',\n",
       " '\"Maybe it fell out of your pocket when we were running?\" Hermione suggested anxiously.\\n',\n",
       " '\"Yeah,\" said Harry, \"maybe. .\\n',\n",
       " 'He usually kept his wand with him at all times in the wizarding world, and finding himself without it in the midst of a scene like this made him feel very vulnerable.\\n',\n",
       " 'A rustling noise nearby made all three of them jump. Winky the house-elf was fighting her way out of a clump of bushes nearby.  She was moving in a most peculiar fashion, apparently with great difficulty; it was as though someone invisible were trying to hold her back.\\n',\n",
       " '\"There is bad wizards about!\" she squeaked distractedly as she leaned forward and labored to keep running.  \"People high - high in the air!  Winky is getting out of the way!\"\\n',\n",
       " 'And she disappeared into the trees on the other side of the path, panting and squeaking as she fought the force that was restraining her.\\n',\n",
       " '\"What\\'s up with her?\" said Ron, looking curiously after Winky.  \"Why can\\'t she run properly?\"\\n',\n",
       " '\"Bet she didn\\'t ask permission to hide,\" said Harry.  He was thinking of Dobby:  Every time he had tried to do something the Malfoys wouldn\\'t like, the house-elf had been forced to start beating himself up.\\n',\n",
       " ' \"You know, house-elves get a very raw deal!\" said Hermione indignantly. \"It\\'s slavery, that\\'s what it is!  That Mr. Crouch made her go up to the top of the stadium, and she was terrified, and he\\'s got her bewitched so she can\\'t even run when they start trampling tents!  Why doesn\\'t anyone do something about it?\"\\n',\n",
       " '\"Well, the elves are happy, aren\\'t they?\"  Ron said.  \"You heard old Winky back at the match.. . \\'House-elves is not supposed to have fun\\'. . . that\\'s what she likes, being bossed around. . . .\"\\n',\n",
       " '\"It\\'s people like you, Ron,\" Hermione began hotly, \"who prop up rotten and unjust systems, just because they\\'re too lazy to -\"\\n',\n",
       " 'Another loud bang echoed from the edge of the wood.\\n',\n",
       " '\"Let\\'s just keep moving, shall we?\" said Ron, and Harry saw him glance edgily at Hermione.  Perhaps there was truth in what Malfoy had said; perhaps Hermione was in more danger than they were.  They set off again, Harry still searching his pockets, even though he knew his wand wasn\\'t there.\\n',\n",
       " 'They followed the dark path deeper into the wood, still keeping an eye out for Fred, George, and Ginny.  They passed a group of goblins who were cackling over a sack of gold that they had undoubtedly won betting on the match, and who seemed quite unperturbed by the trouble at the campsite.  Farther still along the path, they walked into a patch of silvery light, and when they looked through the trees, they saw three tall and beautiful veela standing in a clearing, surrounded by a gaggle of young wizards, all of whom were talking very loudly.\\n',\n",
       " '\"I pull down about a hundred sacks of Galleons a year!\"  one of them shouted.  \"I\\'m a dragon killer for the Committee for the Disposal of Dangerous Creatures.\"\\n',\n",
       " ' \"No, you\\'re not!\"  yelled his friend.  \"You\\'re a dishwasher at the Leaky Cauldron. . . . but I\\'m a vampire hunter, I\\'ve killed about ninety so far -\"\\n',\n",
       " 'A third young wizard, whose pimples were visible even by the dim, silvery light of the veela, now cut in, \"I\\'m about to become the youngest ever Minister of Magic, I am.\"\\n',\n",
       " 'Harry snorted with laughter. He recognized the pimply wizard:  His name was Stan Shunpike, and he was in fact a conductor on the triple-decker Knight Bus.  He turned to tell Ron this, but Ron\\'s face had gone oddly slack, and next second Ron was yelling,  \"Did I tell you I\\'ve invented a broomstick that\\'ll reach Jupiter?\"\\n',\n",
       " '\"Honestly!\" said Hermione, and she and Harry grabbed Ron firmly by the arms, wheeled him around, and marched him away. By the time the sounds of the veela and their admirers had faded completely, they were in the very heart of the wood.  They seemed to be alone now; everything was much quieter.\\n',\n",
       " 'Harry looked around. \"I reckon we can just wait here, you know.  We\\'ll hear anyone coming a mile off.\"\\n',\n",
       " 'The words were hardly out of his mouth, when Ludo Bagman emerged from behind a tree right ahead of them.\\n',\n",
       " 'Even by the feeble light of the two wands, Harry could see that a great change had come over Bagman.  He no longer looked buoyant and rosy-faced; there was no more spring in his step.  He looked very white and strained.\\n',\n",
       " '\"Who\\'s that?\" he said, blinking down at them, trying to make out their faces.  \"What are you doing in here, all alone?\"\\n',\n",
       " 'They looked at one another, surprised.\\n',\n",
       " '\"Well - there\\'s a sort of riot going on,\" said Ron.\\n',\n",
       " 'Bagman stared at him.\\n',\n",
       " '\"What?\"\\n',\n",
       " '\"At the campsite. . . some people have got hold of a family of Muggles. . .\\n',\n",
       " 'Bagman swore loudly.\\n',\n",
       " '\"Damn them!\" he said, looking quite distracted, and without another word, he Disapparated with a small pop!\\n',\n",
       " '\"Not exactly on top of things, Mr. Bagman, is he?\" said Hermione, frowning.\\n',\n",
       " '\"He was a great Beater, though,\" said Ron, leading the way off the path into a small clearing, and sitting down on a patch of dry grass at the foot of a tree.  \"The Wimbourne Wasps won the league three times in a row while he was with them.\"\\n',\n",
